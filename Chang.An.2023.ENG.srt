1
00:00:52,167 --> 00:00:56,167
A few years after
An Lushan rebelled against the Tang

2
00:00:56,167 --> 00:00:59,583
the dynasty's western borders lay undefended.

3
00:00:59,583 --> 00:01:04,708
The Tubos went on the warpath.

4
00:01:43,333 --> 00:01:46,500
Late winter,
the first year of Emperor Daizong's reign.

5
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:47,917
FORT YUNSHAN, SICHUAN

6
00:02:20,542 --> 00:02:23,875
GAO SHI, SOUTHWEST SICHUAN GOVERNOR

7
00:02:33,292 --> 00:02:35,708
Governor Gao!

8
00:03:24,417 --> 00:03:26,125
Our main forces are on their way.

9
00:03:26,250 --> 00:03:28,083
You people of this little fort

10
00:03:28,125 --> 00:03:29,208
are all going to die.

11
00:03:45,625 --> 00:03:46,750
Abandon the fort.

12
00:03:46,833 --> 00:03:48,833
Retreat to Lushui Pass.

13
00:04:11,375 --> 00:04:15,958
LUSHUI PASS

14
00:04:23,042 --> 00:04:24,375
Governor Gao!

15
00:04:37,125 --> 00:04:39,500
The Emperor has fled the capital?

16
00:04:40,875 --> 00:04:41,583
Yes.

17
00:04:42,542 --> 00:04:43,792
His Majesty is in Shanzhou.

18
00:04:44,917 --> 00:04:47,417
The Tubos have besieged Chang'an.

19
00:04:48,042 --> 00:04:49,708
Marshal Guo Ziyi's army -

20
00:04:49,708 --> 00:04:51,250
where are they?

21
00:04:51,625 --> 00:04:52,958
Still in Lantian.

22
00:04:53,333 --> 00:04:55,708
More ministers and generals have been executed.

23
00:04:57,542 --> 00:05:00,125
His Majesty is resolute.

24
00:05:00,542 --> 00:05:02,083
As soon as he took the throne

25
00:05:02,083 --> 00:05:04,292
he executed Li Fuguo and Chancellor Yuan.

26
00:05:04,958 --> 00:05:07,625
These are turbulent times.

27
00:05:13,042 --> 00:05:16,000
The court has sent a flurry of orders

28
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,042
urging Your Excellency to lead your army

29
00:05:18,333 --> 00:05:20,417
to attack the Tubo troops in the west-

30
00:05:20,542 --> 00:05:23,208
forcing their main army to turn back

31
00:05:23,208 --> 00:05:24,875
and lift the siege of Chang'an.

32
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,208
Instead, I abandoned Yunshan

33
00:05:31,958 --> 00:05:34,208
and retreated to Lushui Pass.

34
00:05:37,208 --> 00:05:39,500
General Yan Wu will soon take over.

35
00:05:40,042 --> 00:05:41,000
But

36
00:05:42,042 --> 00:05:43,542
you, sir, are still in charge

37
00:05:43,542 --> 00:05:45,500
of the Southwest Sichuan Command.

38
00:05:47,083 --> 00:05:48,083
Of course

39
00:05:48,542 --> 00:05:50,292
when the court assigns blame

40
00:05:50,625 --> 00:05:52,333
I'll be the guilty one.

41
00:05:54,458 --> 00:05:57,375
Bring the Tubo prisoner for interrogation.

42
00:06:02,042 --> 00:06:03,792
You must answer truthfully.

43
00:06:06,333 --> 00:06:07,208
Reporting!

44
00:06:07,583 --> 00:06:08,583
Governor

45
00:06:08,583 --> 00:06:10,208
dozens of cavalry are at the camp gates.

46
00:06:10,208 --> 00:06:11,458
It's extremely urgent.

47
00:06:11,458 --> 00:06:13,667
Says he's an Imperial Envoy, Military Inspector.

48
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:15,500
Military inspector?

49
00:06:15,625 --> 00:06:16,792
Imperial Envoy?!

50
00:06:17,542 --> 00:06:18,875
Go to the gates.

51
00:06:18,875 --> 00:06:20,625
Inspect their credentials.

52
00:06:20,708 --> 00:06:22,042
Receive them courteously.

53
00:06:22,125 --> 00:06:23,083
Yes sir.

54
00:06:34,542 --> 00:06:37,583
It's Heaven's Will!

55
00:06:39,583 --> 00:06:41,375
Take the Tubo away.

56
00:06:41,375 --> 00:06:42,667
Chain him up outside the tent.

57
00:06:42,667 --> 00:06:43,375
Yes sir.

58
00:06:43,375 --> 00:06:44,750
Get up! Move!

59
00:06:56,708 --> 00:06:58,000
Governor Gao!

60
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,792
Governor Gao!

61
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,333
Someone, help!

62
00:07:12,333 --> 00:07:16,292
IMPERIAL GUARD LIEUTENANT

63
00:07:52,458 --> 00:07:53,375
Governor!

64
00:07:55,375 --> 00:07:56,333
Governor!

65
00:08:06,542 --> 00:08:07,833
Inspector Cheng.

66
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:12,125
For not riding out to greet you

67
00:08:13,167 --> 00:08:14,417
I apologise.

68
00:08:16,042 --> 00:08:17,792
The Emperor sent me west

69
00:08:18,958 --> 00:08:21,167
to ask you some questions, sir.

70
00:08:22,250 --> 00:08:25,000
Please answer them all.

71
00:08:28,167 --> 00:08:29,792
If you cover up anything, sir

72
00:08:29,917 --> 00:08:31,667
or are less than clear

73
00:08:32,458 --> 00:08:34,417
I am authorised

74
00:08:36,042 --> 00:08:37,000
to execute you

75
00:08:38,167 --> 00:08:40,500
and punish your entire clan.

76
00:08:42,208 --> 00:08:46,208
I was about to kill myself for failing the emperor.

77
00:08:46,750 --> 00:08:48,333
Ask, sir,

78
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:50,375
and I'll say all I know.

79
00:08:50,375 --> 00:08:51,500
Li Bai.

80
00:08:52,083 --> 00:08:53,542
Li Bai?

81
00:08:54,292 --> 00:08:57,083
Li Bai. Li Taibai.

82
00:08:57,417 --> 00:08:59,292
Imperial Scholar.

83
00:08:59,292 --> 00:09:00,917
Calls himself Green Lotus Hermit.

84
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:03,125
Li Bai.

85
00:09:04,750 --> 00:09:06,667
Li Bai?

86
00:09:07,292 --> 00:09:11,208
You're not here about the Tubos?

87
00:09:13,250 --> 00:09:15,208
How did you meet Li Bai?

88
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:17,167
Start from the beginning.

89
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,083
He was...

90
00:09:20,458 --> 00:09:22,958
he was once my good friend.

91
00:09:24,542 --> 00:09:27,375
We bonded over poetry.

92
00:09:28,250 --> 00:09:30,167
All people of the Tang write poetry

93
00:09:30,167 --> 00:09:33,333
from His Majesty down to peddlars.

94
00:09:33,625 --> 00:09:35,000
What's special about that?

95
00:09:41,875 --> 00:09:48,375
Sunset's clouds color a twilit sky

96
00:09:49,208 --> 00:09:52,917
Geese ride the North Wind through falling snow.

97
00:09:54,542 --> 00:09:58,542
Don't fear loneliness on the road ahead

98
00:09:59,792 --> 00:10:05,333
For who in this world doesn't know you?

99
00:10:07,250 --> 00:10:09,208
I've heard that poem before.

100
00:10:12,375 --> 00:10:15,458
I wrote it when I was thirty.

101
00:10:15,458 --> 00:10:18,167
as a farewell to Dong Da.

102
00:10:19,083 --> 00:10:21,500
I was so young and ignorant!

103
00:10:22,250 --> 00:10:23,708
Even if everyone knows you

104
00:10:23,708 --> 00:10:25,500
( Poetry of the Rivers and Mountains )
Even if everyone knows you

105
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:26,292
( Poetry of the Rivers and Mountains )
how many count as true friends?

106
00:10:26,292 --> 00:10:29,417
how many count as true friends?

107
00:10:30,083 --> 00:10:33,042
So if Li Bai was once your true friend,

108
00:10:33,917 --> 00:10:35,500
why, five years ago,

109
00:10:35,625 --> 00:10:38,542
did you seek to destroy him?

110
00:10:38,792 --> 00:10:39,958
Governor !

111
00:10:47,583 --> 00:10:49,750
We met when we were young.

112
00:10:50,958 --> 00:10:52,750
I was twenty.

113
00:10:53,208 --> 00:10:54,875
It was near Dongting Lake.

114
00:10:55,792 --> 00:10:57,292
We met

115
00:10:58,542 --> 00:11:00,375
when he tried to kill me.

116
00:11:02,625 --> 00:11:06,917
I'd left home for the first time.

117
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:11,917
I'm from the Gao clan of Bohai.

118
00:11:12,292 --> 00:11:14,083
The 35th boy in my generation.

119
00:11:14,542 --> 00:11:16,792
They called me "Gao Thirty-Five".

120
00:11:17,708 --> 00:11:22,458
My grandfather served Emperor Gaozong
as Northeast Commander.

121
00:11:22,958 --> 00:11:25,708
He crushed the Turks and Goguryeo.

122
00:11:26,417 --> 00:11:28,792
He was buried next to Emperor Gaozong's tomb

123
00:11:29,042 --> 00:11:33,458
and made Prince of Bohai.

124
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,833
GAO SHI AS A YOUTH

125
00:11:35,833 --> 00:11:38,917
( GAO CHONGWEN)
My father had great expectations of me.

126
00:11:39,458 --> 00:11:40,792
He hoped that one day

127
00:11:40,792 --> 00:11:42,417
I'd be like my grandfather

128
00:11:42,417 --> 00:11:45,917
flying the banner beyond the Great Desert.

129
00:11:48,958 --> 00:11:53,667
Confucius said
"To practice what you learn

130
00:11:53,667 --> 00:11:55,500
But learning to read

131
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:57,917
was really difficult for me.

132
00:11:57,917 --> 00:11:59,458
When I looked at a book

133
00:11:59,458 --> 00:12:02,875
the characters swam on the page like tadpoles.

134
00:12:02,875 --> 00:12:05,708
racing around, just a big mess.

135
00:12:13,375 --> 00:12:19,417
"Do you do your utmost to help others?"

136
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:31,208
Father

137
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,667
F-forgive me.

138
00:12:34,833 --> 00:12:37,708
The Gao Spear has a worthy heir.

139
00:12:47,833 --> 00:12:50,875
My father was a warrior-scholar.

140
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,708
But when he died, in Shao, Guangdong,

141
00:12:56,125 --> 00:12:59,958
He was but a minor official of a minor county.

142
00:13:01,250 --> 00:13:05,583
I was sixteen. My mother had long passed away.

143
00:13:05,917 --> 00:13:09,333
Father managed his affairs poorly. We had nothing.

144
00:13:10,458 --> 00:13:13,792
I took his ashes from Guangdong back to Guangling

145
00:13:13,958 --> 00:13:18,333
I came home to an empty house.

146
00:13:19,583 --> 00:13:24,000
I was left all alone in the world.

147
00:13:25,292 --> 00:13:27,083
After three years of mourning

148
00:13:27,333 --> 00:13:30,417
I left home for the capital, Chang'an.

149
00:13:30,708 --> 00:13:34,333
I didn't read well but I had martial skills.

150
00:13:34,833 --> 00:13:37,958
It was Kaiyuan, the Tang's Golden Age.

151
00:13:38,208 --> 00:13:38,458
I would go straight to Chang'an,

152
00:13:38,458 --> 00:13:39,708
GAO SHI
I would go straight to Chang'an,

153
00:13:39,708 --> 00:13:41,625
GAO SHI
serve the Emperor,

154
00:13:41,625 --> 00:13:42,167
GAO SHI
make my name

155
00:13:42,167 --> 00:13:43,833
make my name

156
00:13:43,958 --> 00:13:47,708
and restore the glory of my family.

157
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:02,292
I didn't expect travel to be so hard.

158
00:14:04,208 --> 00:14:06,167
I rode west from Guangling.

159
00:14:06,542 --> 00:14:08,042
After almost a month

160
00:14:08,167 --> 00:14:11,667
I'd only reached Dongting Lake

161
00:14:12,542 --> 00:14:15,792
and my money was running out.

162
00:14:20,292 --> 00:14:21,333
Outta the way!

163
00:14:28,667 --> 00:14:29,458
Thief!

164
00:14:30,042 --> 00:14:30,917
Stop!

165
00:14:38,583 --> 00:14:40,875
Damn thief. You're skilled.

166
00:14:42,542 --> 00:14:44,083
But you're no hero up on that horse.

167
00:14:44,333 --> 00:14:45,500
If you're a true fighter, dismount.

168
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:46,708
We'll see who wins then!

169
00:14:49,833 --> 00:14:52,792
S-sir, who are you calling a thief?

170
00:14:53,083 --> 00:14:55,500
You steal my horse and bags and you're no thief?

171
00:15:08,958 --> 00:15:10,583
You're good at this, thief.

172
00:15:10,667 --> 00:15:12,375
To block my sword isn't easy.

173
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:15,083
But with such skill, why thieve?

174
00:15:16,958 --> 00:15:19,292
J-just now two horses galloped past.

175
00:15:19,750 --> 00:15:21,500
They had saddlebags.

176
00:15:21,833 --> 00:15:23,208
I think they were your thieves.

177
00:15:24,167 --> 00:15:25,542
If you're not a thief

178
00:15:25,708 --> 00:15:27,208
why do you wear the same hat?

179
00:15:29,625 --> 00:15:31,500
Oh! A c-coincidence.

180
00:15:32,958 --> 00:15:34,667
Okay, I believe you!

181
00:15:35,542 --> 00:15:37,458
Lend me your horse!

182
00:15:37,750 --> 00:15:38,958
My horse!

183
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:49,042
You're quite the warrior.

184
00:16:49,125 --> 00:16:50,375
Thank you for saving me.

185
00:16:50,625 --> 00:16:52,167
Earlier, I falsely accused you.

186
00:16:52,167 --> 00:16:53,542
I beg your pardon.

187
00:16:54,083 --> 00:16:56,375
No n-need to apologise.

188
00:16:56,917 --> 00:16:58,208
The law of the Tang

189
00:16:58,208 --> 00:16:59,708
says if a civilian meets a thief

190
00:17:00,542 --> 00:17:02,000
killing him isn't a crime.

191
00:17:02,208 --> 00:17:04,250
Otherwise, I couldn't have helped you.

192
00:17:05,958 --> 00:17:10,708
Y-you know a lot about the law!

193
00:17:10,708 --> 00:17:14,208
B-brother, don't mock me.

194
00:17:14,208 --> 00:17:16,875
So young, and yet so formal.

195
00:17:17,458 --> 00:17:18,292
Thank you.

196
00:17:18,833 --> 00:17:19,417
Li Bai, at your service.

197
00:17:19,417 --> 00:17:20,000
LI BAI
Li Bai, at your service.

198
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:20,750
LI BAI

199
00:17:22,625 --> 00:17:25,125
Gao Shi, at yours.

200
00:17:26,583 --> 00:17:30,458
Gao Shi, lucky you lent me your horse.

201
00:17:30,667 --> 00:17:33,500
If I didn't catch them, I'd never forgive myself.

202
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:35,958
- What you're carrying - it's valuable?

203
00:17:36,208 --> 00:17:38,167
I wouldn't care if it was gold or silver.

204
00:17:38,792 --> 00:17:39,625
But this

205
00:17:40,917 --> 00:17:42,917
This is my dear friend Wu Zhinan.

206
00:17:43,208 --> 00:17:45,333
Brother Wu meet Brother Gao.

207
00:17:46,958 --> 00:17:47,792
This is...?

208
00:17:49,458 --> 00:17:52,167
We studied together in our youth.

209
00:17:52,375 --> 00:17:55,208
After I left Sichuan I ran into him at Mt Lu.

210
00:17:55,667 --> 00:17:58,708
We looked for a Taoist master together.

211
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:01,125
But fate was cruel.

212
00:18:01,625 --> 00:18:04,542
Three years ago, he took ill and died.

213
00:18:05,375 --> 00:18:06,500
I made a pledge

214
00:18:06,833 --> 00:18:10,750
to take his remains somewhere beautiful

215
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,833
and bury him there.

216
00:18:14,667 --> 00:18:16,583
These are his remains?

217
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:17,917
That's right!

218
00:18:18,125 --> 00:18:20,042
I'll bury him by Yellow Crane Tower.

219
00:18:20,375 --> 00:18:21,958
Let that famous tower be his companion.

220
00:18:22,208 --> 00:18:23,583
A marvellous idea, right?

221
00:18:25,417 --> 00:18:26,625
Come, Brother Gao

222
00:18:26,833 --> 00:18:28,958
Come with me. Let's go!

223
00:18:30,333 --> 00:18:34,292
I'd never met anyone like him.

224
00:18:48,292 --> 00:18:50,792
He said his family was from Longxi.

225
00:18:51,167 --> 00:18:53,542
A 19th generation descendent of Li Guang

226
00:18:53,875 --> 00:18:56,750
related to the imperial clan.

227
00:18:57,292 --> 00:18:58,875
He used to live in Sichuan

228
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:03,042
but was wandering the land, courting officials

229
00:19:03,417 --> 00:19:05,583
in the hope one would recognise his talent

230
00:19:05,667 --> 00:19:07,625
and commend him to the court

231
00:19:08,292 --> 00:19:10,250
so he could serve the country.

232
00:19:18,958 --> 00:19:20,542
Here you go!

233
00:19:22,875 --> 00:19:23,542
Enjoy!

234
00:19:32,333 --> 00:19:32,833
Brother Gao

235
00:19:34,208 --> 00:19:35,750
we've got time.

236
00:19:35,917 --> 00:19:38,042
How you killed that thief with your spear

237
00:19:38,125 --> 00:19:39,792
it was like a flying dragon.

238
00:19:40,792 --> 00:19:42,583
If you'll teach me spear fighting

239
00:19:42,792 --> 00:19:43,958
I'd be happy

240
00:19:44,292 --> 00:19:45,667
to teach you

241
00:19:45,667 --> 00:19:47,958
the art of wrestling. Say yes?

242
00:19:48,458 --> 00:19:49,750
Let's do it.

243
00:20:00,958 --> 00:20:02,083
The Way of wrestling

244
00:20:02,292 --> 00:20:03,667
is to answer force with feints

245
00:20:04,375 --> 00:20:05,542
distract to attack

246
00:20:05,667 --> 00:20:07,292
and rely on variation.

247
00:20:08,708 --> 00:20:09,750
The key

248
00:20:10,208 --> 00:20:11,792
is to trick your opponent.

249
00:20:51,083 --> 00:20:53,417
It's too easy to see through you.

250
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:54,833
Gao Shi-

251
00:20:55,167 --> 00:20:57,375
know how to trick an opponent?

252
00:21:19,583 --> 00:21:21,042
When I was eighteen

253
00:21:21,167 --> 00:21:21,958
I went to Mt. Changping

254
00:21:21,958 --> 00:21:24,167
to study strategy with a Master Zhao.

255
00:21:24,250 --> 00:21:26,917
I never mastered strategy

256
00:21:27,083 --> 00:21:28,667
but I did learn Master Zhao's

257
00:21:28,667 --> 00:21:30,458
art of beckoning the birds.

258
00:21:41,750 --> 00:21:43,417
There's a North Sea fish

259
00:21:43,417 --> 00:21:45,042
That's called the Kun

260
00:21:45,750 --> 00:21:47,250
It transforms into a bird

261
00:21:47,458 --> 00:21:49,833
That's called the Eagle

262
00:21:49,833 --> 00:21:51,292
Li Bai.

263
00:21:51,542 --> 00:21:53,583
I'd never met anyone like him.

264
00:21:53,583 --> 00:21:55,583
So free in spirit.

265
00:21:55,958 --> 00:21:58,000
He lived in this world

266
00:21:58,083 --> 00:22:02,083
but seemed apart from it as well.

267
00:22:03,333 --> 00:22:04,333
Got it!

268
00:22:07,167 --> 00:22:08,208
Brother Gao

269
00:22:08,208 --> 00:22:09,958
Living in such a golden age as this

270
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,625
we shall be Great Eagles!

271
00:22:18,917 --> 00:22:24,750
JIANGXIA YELLOW CRANE TOWER

272
00:22:34,542 --> 00:22:39,833
The yellow birds flit

273
00:22:41,375 --> 00:22:46,042
And perch upon the jujube tree.

274
00:22:48,042 --> 00:22:54,042
Whilst cruel fate

275
00:22:54,792 --> 00:22:58,792
steals the life of a good man.

276
00:22:58,792 --> 00:23:01,750
"Here lies Wu Zhinan"
steals the life of a good man.

277
00:23:01,750 --> 00:23:02,750
"Here lies Wu Zhinan"

278
00:23:05,292 --> 00:23:07,958
The Great Eagle never spread its wings

279
00:23:07,958 --> 00:23:10,167
dying young and far from home.

280
00:23:12,625 --> 00:23:14,958
O grief! O sorrow!

281
00:23:15,750 --> 00:23:17,208
Brother Wu

282
00:23:19,667 --> 00:23:21,292
O grief!

283
00:23:22,042 --> 00:23:24,667
O sorrow!

284
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:47,708
Brother Gao

285
00:23:47,917 --> 00:23:49,750
life is like the morning dew.

286
00:23:51,417 --> 00:23:53,125
Blink and it's gone.

287
00:23:53,792 --> 00:23:55,125
So tragic.

288
00:23:57,542 --> 00:23:59,625
One day I'll devote myself to the Tao.

289
00:24:00,083 --> 00:24:01,542
I'll discover the path

290
00:24:01,583 --> 00:24:03,042
to immortality.

291
00:24:03,750 --> 00:24:05,333
Brother Li

292
00:24:05,750 --> 00:24:07,625
"Confucius never speaks of the occult."

293
00:24:07,875 --> 00:24:09,125
The Tao of Immortality

294
00:24:09,500 --> 00:24:10,625
is too.. too illusory.

295
00:24:11,917 --> 00:24:12,833
Brother Gao

296
00:24:13,333 --> 00:24:14,958
Nothing in life is easy.

297
00:24:15,333 --> 00:24:17,083
In my time in this world

298
00:24:17,292 --> 00:24:19,208
I want to do the hardest things.

299
00:24:19,667 --> 00:24:20,958
One day

300
00:24:21,125 --> 00:24:22,125
I'll prove myself.

301
00:24:22,125 --> 00:24:23,250
Make a name.

302
00:24:23,250 --> 00:24:25,042
Become a hermit, find the Tao.

303
00:24:26,792 --> 00:24:27,958
But before I can do that

304
00:24:27,958 --> 00:24:29,417
I must achieve official rank.

305
00:24:29,833 --> 00:24:31,500
I've heard that the governor here

306
00:24:31,500 --> 00:24:32,500
has a great eye for talent.

307
00:24:32,833 --> 00:24:33,792
Brother Gao

308
00:24:33,958 --> 00:24:35,792
you've heard of "Passing the Scroll"?

309
00:24:36,042 --> 00:24:37,417
Of course.

310
00:24:39,500 --> 00:24:41,042
This governor loves essays.

311
00:24:41,250 --> 00:24:43,417
I wrote "Ode to the Great Eagle" for him.

312
00:24:43,500 --> 00:24:45,417
He'll promote me for sure.

313
00:24:47,958 --> 00:24:51,208
The dynasty has a system for promoting talent.

314
00:24:51,417 --> 00:24:53,125
Officials of high rank

315
00:24:53,125 --> 00:24:55,500
were responsible for recommending talent.

316
00:24:55,917 --> 00:24:59,750
So literati presented their best work

317
00:24:59,750 --> 00:25:02,042
to prominent officials

318
00:25:02,417 --> 00:25:03,875
to get recognition.

319
00:25:04,458 --> 00:25:06,875
It was a shortcut to official rank

320
00:25:06,875 --> 00:25:08,625
It was called "Passing the Scroll".

321
00:25:10,667 --> 00:25:11,875
But...

322
00:25:12,917 --> 00:25:14,542
How can such shortcuts

323
00:25:15,042 --> 00:25:17,375
be open to those of humble birth?

324
00:25:39,958 --> 00:25:41,542
The Tang soldiers are terrified.

325
00:25:41,542 --> 00:25:42,542
You've seen that.

326
00:25:42,542 --> 00:25:44,125
Gao Shi has been relieved of his command.

327
00:25:44,750 --> 00:25:46,000
Once the Tubo army arrives

328
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:47,542
they'll take Lushui Pass, easy.

329
00:25:48,042 --> 00:25:49,667
We're also northern tribesmen.

330
00:25:49,667 --> 00:25:51,167
We won't die for them.

331
00:25:54,375 --> 00:25:55,917
Your army must act fast.

332
00:25:55,958 --> 00:25:58,417
Yan Wu takes command in two days.

333
00:25:58,750 --> 00:25:59,750
Yan Wu?

334
00:25:59,750 --> 00:26:01,000
Yan Wu is coming back?

335
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:03,167
Yes! You know how strong he is.

336
00:26:03,500 --> 00:26:05,125
We have to do this before that!

337
00:26:05,542 --> 00:26:06,542
When the army arrives

338
00:26:06,542 --> 00:26:07,708
we'll open the gates.

339
00:26:07,917 --> 00:26:09,500
The tribesman are all prepared.

340
00:26:10,958 --> 00:26:11,792
Understood!

341
00:26:18,042 --> 00:26:19,292
But Li Bai

342
00:26:19,792 --> 00:26:23,083
naturally didn't think that doors

343
00:26:23,083 --> 00:26:24,833
wouldn't open for him.

344
00:26:26,833 --> 00:26:30,042
JIANGXIA COUNTY GOVERNOR'S RESIDENCE

345
00:26:34,792 --> 00:26:35,542
Brother Li-

346
00:26:36,292 --> 00:26:38,667
I'll wait here for you.

347
00:26:38,833 --> 00:26:40,750
Brother Gao, come with me!

348
00:26:40,750 --> 00:26:42,167
No need to wait outside.

349
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:44,417
This governor

350
00:26:44,500 --> 00:26:45,875
I've never been introduced.

351
00:26:46,250 --> 00:26:49,000
Our families have no ties either.

352
00:26:50,500 --> 00:26:51,417
Brother Gao

353
00:26:51,625 --> 00:26:53,125
my talent

354
00:26:53,125 --> 00:26:54,875
is superior to a thousand introductions

355
00:26:54,875 --> 00:26:56,375
and a million years of ties.

356
00:26:57,458 --> 00:26:58,625
I'm going.

357
00:27:04,625 --> 00:27:06,375
Please go away.

358
00:27:06,458 --> 00:27:08,708
The governor is tied up with official business.

359
00:27:08,708 --> 00:27:10,250
He can't see you.

360
00:27:10,458 --> 00:27:12,042
Has he read my essay?

361
00:27:12,875 --> 00:27:14,917
Your father was a merchant?

362
00:27:15,708 --> 00:27:16,542
Yes.

363
00:27:16,542 --> 00:27:17,917
He was a trader

364
00:27:17,917 --> 00:27:19,750
with businesses in Jinling and Yangzhou.

365
00:27:20,750 --> 00:27:23,500
The descendant of a pedlar

366
00:27:23,500 --> 00:27:25,333
and you dare to "Pass the Scroll"?

367
00:27:29,958 --> 00:27:33,375
He has eyes but cannot see!

368
00:27:36,208 --> 00:27:38,250
Blind!

369
00:27:39,292 --> 00:27:40,750
Blind!

370
00:27:56,042 --> 00:27:57,792
Brother Gao! Let's go.

371
00:27:58,292 --> 00:27:59,708
To argue with such an ignoramus

372
00:27:59,708 --> 00:28:00,875
is below us.

373
00:28:01,500 --> 00:28:02,875
Let's go to Yellow Crane Tower for a drink.

374
00:28:02,875 --> 00:28:03,958
What do you say?

375
00:28:04,167 --> 00:28:05,667
Let's go, Brother Gao!

376
00:28:08,167 --> 00:28:09,667
That's how I learned

377
00:28:09,833 --> 00:28:12,667
Li Bai was the son of a merchant.

378
00:28:13,500 --> 00:28:15,208
By the laws of our dynasty

379
00:28:15,375 --> 00:28:18,500
even a wealthy merchant belongs to the lower class.

380
00:28:18,833 --> 00:28:19,958
The son of a merchant

381
00:28:19,958 --> 00:28:22,375
can't even take the civil service exam.

382
00:28:22,417 --> 00:28:23,292
C'mon, Brother Gao!

383
00:28:23,292 --> 00:28:24,792
To get an official position

384
00:28:24,792 --> 00:28:28,958
he had to "Pass the Scroll" and find a patron.

385
00:28:29,333 --> 00:28:31,417
- But wasn't this
- One day the Great Eagle will rise

386
00:28:31,417 --> 00:28:33,167
- even a harder road?
- One day the Great Eagle will rise

387
00:28:33,167 --> 00:28:35,042
And ride the wind

388
00:28:35,042 --> 00:28:38,500
- His genius could light the dark.
- for ten thousand miles.

389
00:28:38,667 --> 00:28:39,000
His brilliance was obvious.

390
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:40,208
YELLOW CRANE TOWER
His brilliance was obvious.

391
00:28:40,208 --> 00:28:41,000
YELLOW CRANE TOWER

392
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:42,167
YELLOW CRANE TOWER
But I'd never met anyone

393
00:28:42,167 --> 00:28:43,000
But I'd never met anyone

394
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:46,000
so childishly innocent as well.

395
00:28:50,250 --> 00:28:51,625
Waiter! Come!

396
00:28:51,625 --> 00:28:53,208
Coming!

397
00:28:53,333 --> 00:28:55,208
Bring us your best wine.

398
00:28:55,292 --> 00:28:56,250
Sure thing!

399
00:29:00,250 --> 00:29:02,375
Brother Gao bottoms up!

400
00:29:05,250 --> 00:29:06,708
Brother Gao, come, quick.

401
00:29:13,833 --> 00:29:15,292
See the Yangtze?

402
00:29:19,417 --> 00:29:21,708
It flows from my hometown.

403
00:29:25,125 --> 00:29:26,958
Endless waters, countless peaks

404
00:29:27,333 --> 00:29:30,875
this river brought me here.

405
00:29:34,208 --> 00:29:37,208
Brother Gao, does your home have great rivers too?

406
00:29:38,167 --> 00:29:40,792
Bohai has the Yellow River.

407
00:29:42,458 --> 00:29:44,292
I've yet to see the Yellow River.

408
00:29:45,042 --> 00:29:49,042
But I know the poem "Upon Stork Tower"

409
00:29:50,625 --> 00:29:54,417
The sun rests on the peak before it fades

410
00:29:54,417 --> 00:29:58,000
The Yellow River flows towards the sea

411
00:29:59,958 --> 00:30:03,708
Wang Zhihuan's wonderful poem.

412
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:14,833
Waiter! Waiter!

413
00:30:14,833 --> 00:30:16,333
Coming!

414
00:30:16,333 --> 00:30:17,542
What can I do for you, sir?

415
00:30:17,875 --> 00:30:19,125
I'm overcome with inspiration.

416
00:30:19,125 --> 00:30:21,958
I want to dedicate a poem to Yellow Crane Tower.

417
00:30:21,958 --> 00:30:23,708
Where are your poetry boards?

418
00:30:23,958 --> 00:30:26,250
Ah, sir, you write poetry?

419
00:30:26,458 --> 00:30:27,542
Of course.

420
00:30:27,833 --> 00:30:28,958
Sir,

421
00:30:29,083 --> 00:30:30,917
do you have official rank, then?

422
00:30:31,583 --> 00:30:34,167
I'll have one soon, it's in reach!

423
00:30:34,167 --> 00:30:36,750
Sir, why don't I bring you more dishes?

424
00:30:36,750 --> 00:30:38,375
Writing poetry is so demanding.

425
00:30:38,375 --> 00:30:41,000
Stop stalling. Take me to the poetry boards.

426
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:42,125
Alright.

427
00:30:43,917 --> 00:30:45,000
C'mon.

428
00:30:49,750 --> 00:30:51,958
Our tower has a long history.

429
00:30:52,042 --> 00:30:55,000
For centuries, guests have left poems here.

430
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:56,958
Just look around, sir.

431
00:30:56,958 --> 00:30:58,792
A fine place.

432
00:31:00,917 --> 00:31:03,417
Waiter, of all the poems here

433
00:31:03,417 --> 00:31:05,208
which is the best one?

434
00:31:05,292 --> 00:31:06,792
I will write one next to it.

435
00:31:06,833 --> 00:31:07,833
- Who's this person?
- To date the best one...

436
00:31:07,833 --> 00:31:09,583
- Judging from his clothes,
- To date the best one...

437
00:31:09,583 --> 00:31:10,917
a commoner.

438
00:31:10,958 --> 00:31:12,125
I'm not so learned

439
00:31:12,125 --> 00:31:14,250
but visitors all agree

440
00:31:14,250 --> 00:31:15,958
it's one written just two years ago.

441
00:31:15,958 --> 00:31:17,500
Just two years ago?

442
00:31:17,500 --> 00:31:19,625
It's by Master Cui Hao.

443
00:31:19,875 --> 00:31:22,292
He's from the Cui clan of Boling.

444
00:31:22,375 --> 00:31:25,542
The Cuis are first among the Six Great Clans.

445
00:31:25,625 --> 00:31:26,833
Young Master Cui

446
00:31:26,833 --> 00:31:29,458
passed the civil service exams at nineteen.

447
00:31:29,458 --> 00:31:30,917
Enough. Give me a brush.

448
00:31:32,625 --> 00:31:33,542
Your brush.

449
00:31:34,750 --> 00:31:36,000
This one, right?

450
00:31:36,250 --> 00:31:40,375
He was inspired after drinking.

451
00:31:41,042 --> 00:31:42,792
His calligraphy is marvelous too

452
00:31:42,792 --> 00:31:44,458
it's all marvelous!

453
00:31:48,083 --> 00:31:50,917
The Ancient rode off on the Yellow Crane

454
00:31:51,208 --> 00:31:54,625
Leaving but an empty Yellow Crane Tower here

455
00:31:57,708 --> 00:32:01,292
The Yellow Crane, gone, never to reappear

456
00:32:01,833 --> 00:32:05,708
White clouds drift past, year after year

457
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:16,625
The trees of Hanyang, the sparkling stream

458
00:32:18,458 --> 00:32:22,125
On Parrot Isle, grasses lush and green

459
00:32:28,500 --> 00:32:33,042
Dusk sets in, where is my home?

460
00:32:36,708 --> 00:32:43,375
Mist and waves, a melancholy scene.

461
00:32:47,083 --> 00:32:49,833
Wonderful, really wonderful.

462
00:32:50,792 --> 00:32:52,375
Such great talent!

463
00:32:53,750 --> 00:32:58,208
Master Cui is young elegant, high-born

464
00:32:58,208 --> 00:32:59,917
and so talented too.

465
00:33:06,875 --> 00:33:08,208
Where did those two dolts come from?

466
00:33:08,208 --> 00:33:10,042
Youthful ignorance, that's all.

467
00:33:10,125 --> 00:33:11,708
They're still a pair of dolts.

468
00:33:19,917 --> 00:33:21,000
Brother Gao

469
00:33:22,167 --> 00:33:25,250
You go west to Chang'an, I go east to Yangzhou.

470
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:27,250
Today we part ways.

471
00:33:30,125 --> 00:33:31,042
One day

472
00:33:31,458 --> 00:33:35,083
I'll write Yellow Crane Tower's best-ever poem.

473
00:33:41,125 --> 00:33:43,167
Brother Gao, let's make a date.

474
00:33:43,625 --> 00:33:46,458
In a year, whether you succeed in Chang'an or not

475
00:33:46,458 --> 00:33:48,167
you must visit me in Yangzhou!

476
00:33:48,250 --> 00:33:51,458
I'll show you the wonders by its famous bridges

477
00:33:51,458 --> 00:33:53,167
and its beauties too.

478
00:33:54,958 --> 00:33:58,167
Next year, I'll visit for sure.

479
00:34:00,042 --> 00:34:02,458
I touch my sword.

480
00:34:02,625 --> 00:34:04,500
I raise my eyes.

481
00:34:05,708 --> 00:34:09,375
Like stones in clear water, I shall be seen.

482
00:34:11,708 --> 00:34:13,208
Gao Thirty-five-

483
00:34:13,833 --> 00:34:15,583
That splendid talent of yours

484
00:34:15,875 --> 00:34:18,708
will one day burst forth from your heart.

485
00:34:19,875 --> 00:34:22,000
I take off my cap

486
00:34:22,208 --> 00:34:24,375
We share a smile

487
00:34:25,042 --> 00:34:26,458
We drink wine

488
00:34:26,542 --> 00:34:28,667
And I sing for you.

489
00:34:43,208 --> 00:34:45,000
Chang'an...

490
00:34:46,500 --> 00:34:48,833
It was my first time there.

491
00:34:53,083 --> 00:34:54,500
Chang'an...

492
00:34:57,542 --> 00:35:04,583
CHANG'AN

493
00:35:20,500 --> 00:35:22,958
Oh, I do beg your pardon!

494
00:35:23,167 --> 00:35:26,292
'To govern, first put your own house in order."

495
00:35:26,333 --> 00:35:28,167
Roll call.

496
00:35:28,333 --> 00:35:30,875
Wang Changling?

497
00:35:31,250 --> 00:35:33,875
- Chang Jian! Chang Jian?
- Here, here!

498
00:35:34,292 --> 00:35:36,958
- Raise your hands. Turn around.
- Оkay.

499
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:38,417
I said turn, how hard is that?

500
00:35:38,792 --> 00:35:40,667
Is it so hard to understand?
Now get your butt back into line.

501
00:35:40,667 --> 00:35:43,750
I was a poor student, I'd never pass.

502
00:35:44,250 --> 00:35:46,208
At least I avoided this humiliation.

503
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:48,333
Aside from the exams

504
00:35:48,458 --> 00:35:50,000
there was another path.

505
00:35:50,250 --> 00:35:53,458
The emperor could test and appoint you himself.

506
00:35:53,917 --> 00:35:58,125
He's discerning and looks out for great talent.

507
00:35:58,958 --> 00:36:02,958
But a High Noble has to recommend you first.

508
00:36:07,375 --> 00:36:08,500
Escaped?

509
00:36:09,542 --> 00:36:12,375
Let him go. No need to chase him.

510
00:36:13,875 --> 00:36:16,667
You're young and accomplished.

511
00:36:16,958 --> 00:36:19,250
Who was your mentor at court?

512
00:36:21,083 --> 00:36:22,792
His Excellency, Inspector Eunuch Gao.

513
00:36:24,250 --> 00:36:26,583
He was devoted to the court.

514
00:36:26,583 --> 00:36:29,292
But Empress Zhang and Li Fuguo smeared his name

515
00:36:29,375 --> 00:36:30,792
and he died in exile.

516
00:36:31,875 --> 00:36:34,417
His Majesty has since eliminated that cabal.

517
00:36:35,333 --> 00:36:38,708
I killed Li Fuguo myself.

518
00:36:40,917 --> 00:36:42,708
You're loyal to your mentor.

519
00:36:42,833 --> 00:36:44,333
That's rare.

520
00:36:45,417 --> 00:36:48,375
It's a pity that back then my family

521
00:36:48,833 --> 00:36:51,625
had no one such as yourself.

522
00:36:53,542 --> 00:36:56,708
Only when I got to Chang'an did I know

523
00:36:57,042 --> 00:36:58,708
people there saw the Gaos

524
00:36:58,708 --> 00:37:02,833
as a clan past its prime.

525
00:37:29,708 --> 00:37:34,750
PRINCE QI'S RESIDENCE, CHANG'AN

526
00:37:47,292 --> 00:37:48,000
LI GUINIAN

527
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,208
LI GUINIAN
Watch it.

528
00:37:50,208 --> 00:37:52,625
S-so sorry, Mr Li.

529
00:37:53,375 --> 00:37:56,167
Prince Qi thinks your spear dance marvellous

530
00:37:56,167 --> 00:37:57,917
and insisted I include it

531
00:37:57,917 --> 00:38:00,875
in tonight's program for Princess Yuzhen.

532
00:38:01,500 --> 00:38:03,833
Personally, I don't see

533
00:38:03,833 --> 00:38:06,167
what's so marvellous.

534
00:38:06,667 --> 00:38:08,125
The way you wield it

535
00:38:08,292 --> 00:38:11,708
is less dancer than warrior.

536
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,125
Mr Li, please, please forgive me.

537
00:38:14,375 --> 00:38:15,625
I will do my best

538
00:38:15,667 --> 00:38:17,792
to earn their applause.

539
00:38:18,958 --> 00:38:21,625
Princess Yuzhen is very cultured.

540
00:38:21,625 --> 00:38:23,375
Good luck.

541
00:38:23,375 --> 00:38:24,208
So be it.

542
00:38:24,208 --> 00:38:26,708
I respect Prince Qi's wishes.

543
00:38:32,292 --> 00:38:34,583
I have to go see that zither player too.

544
00:38:35,042 --> 00:38:38,375
Prince Qi pushed two new acts on me tonight.

545
00:38:39,500 --> 00:38:45,542
Sparkling bright as the stream

546
00:38:45,667 --> 00:38:54,375
Their scents and flowers' aroma blend

547
00:38:57,917 --> 00:39:04,083
Whose boys are those loafing on the banks?

548
00:39:10,958 --> 00:39:12,417
Prince Qi.

549
00:39:12,792 --> 00:39:14,875
PRINCESS YUZHEN
PRINCE QI
Only Prince Qi

550
00:39:14,875 --> 00:39:15,292
PRINCESS YUZHEN
PRINCE QI

551
00:39:15,500 --> 00:39:17,250
truly loved talent.

552
00:39:17,875 --> 00:39:18,917
He said

553
00:39:18,917 --> 00:39:22,500
His Majesty adored his sister Yuzhen

554
00:39:22,542 --> 00:39:24,667
If she recommended someone

555
00:39:24,667 --> 00:39:27,625
he'd appoint them.

556
00:39:28,250 --> 00:39:30,625
That night, Prince Qi held a party

557
00:39:30,625 --> 00:39:34,792
so I could show her my skills.

558
00:40:16,042 --> 00:40:17,250
It's a bit scary.

559
00:40:18,667 --> 00:40:21,708
As a battle technique it's superb.

560
00:40:42,792 --> 00:40:44,500
Spear, spear.

561
00:40:44,833 --> 00:40:47,375
The Gao Spear can kill enemies

562
00:40:47,625 --> 00:40:50,083
but it can't impress a woman.

563
00:40:52,667 --> 00:40:54,292
Defaming the princess behind her back.

564
00:40:54,375 --> 00:40:56,208
- Who...
- How dare you, Gao Shi.

565
00:41:02,458 --> 00:41:06,042
I'm teasing. Looks like I scared you.

566
00:41:06,250 --> 00:41:09,125
You... you naughty kid.

567
00:41:09,292 --> 00:41:12,083
Prince Qi told me about tonight's program.

568
00:41:12,333 --> 00:41:13,917
Your spear skills are impressive.

569
00:41:15,375 --> 00:41:16,458
Such a shame

570
00:41:16,458 --> 00:41:19,542
you lack a battlefield to use them on.

571
00:41:19,542 --> 00:41:20,958
Today you must settle

572
00:41:20,958 --> 00:41:24,083
for courting applause at a little party.

573
00:41:25,875 --> 00:41:29,042
Little Master, how are you related to Prince Qi?

574
00:41:29,042 --> 00:41:30,583
I'm not related.

575
00:41:30,583 --> 00:41:33,167
My humble surname is Du, my name is Fu.

576
00:41:33,500 --> 00:41:35,833
DU FU AS A YOUTH
Du Fu, from Jingzhao.

577
00:41:35,833 --> 00:41:37,250
DU FU AS A YOUTH
Ah, the Du family of Jingzhao.

578
00:41:37,250 --> 00:41:38,583
Ah, the Du family of Jingzhao.

579
00:41:38,833 --> 00:41:40,333
It's an honor.

580
00:41:45,542 --> 00:41:46,625
Come, listen.

581
00:41:47,083 --> 00:41:50,042
This is Prince Qi's other program for tonight.

582
00:42:16,208 --> 00:42:19,292
Who's this?

583
00:42:20,083 --> 00:42:22,000
You've surely heard of him.

584
00:42:22,333 --> 00:42:24,417
He's from the Wang clan of Hedong.

585
00:42:24,667 --> 00:42:27,583
WANG WEI
Wang Wei.

586
00:42:27,583 --> 00:42:29,208
WANG WEI

587
00:42:29,417 --> 00:42:33,375
Red beans in the south flourish in the spring.

588
00:42:35,542 --> 00:42:38,208
I knew his poetry and painting were sublime.

589
00:42:38,708 --> 00:42:42,083
but not that he also played so beautifully.

590
00:42:43,458 --> 00:42:44,833
The thing about him

591
00:42:44,833 --> 00:42:46,292
is that he's a bit cold.

592
00:42:46,625 --> 00:42:47,375
I try to talk to him

593
00:42:47,375 --> 00:42:49,250
but he always ignores me.

594
00:42:49,458 --> 00:42:52,375
Such a personality isn't good at
"Passing the Scroll".

595
00:42:52,708 --> 00:42:55,375
So Prince Qi invited him tonight too.

596
00:43:05,708 --> 00:43:07,417
I do like you though.

597
00:43:09,333 --> 00:43:11,625
Gao Shi, what are your other talents?

598
00:43:11,792 --> 00:43:16,292
Princess Yuzhen likes music and dance.

599
00:43:17,667 --> 00:43:18,833
And painting too.

600
00:43:20,500 --> 00:43:23,708
I'm no good at any of that.

601
00:43:24,042 --> 00:43:26,667
But as for poetry...

602
00:43:31,042 --> 00:43:31,792
This way.

603
00:43:31,792 --> 00:43:33,208
So striking and so talented!

604
00:43:33,208 --> 00:43:34,583
What's going on?

605
00:43:35,792 --> 00:43:37,458
This robe suits you better.

606
00:43:45,417 --> 00:43:47,333
Princess Yuzhen is here.

607
00:43:50,083 --> 00:43:51,000
Your Highness.

608
00:43:51,958 --> 00:43:52,792
M'Lord.

609
00:43:53,208 --> 00:43:56,667
I didn't realise you were the famous Wang Wei.

610
00:43:56,667 --> 00:43:59,125
I've wanted to meet you for a long time.

611
00:43:59,292 --> 00:44:01,000
Please, sit with me.

612
00:44:01,250 --> 00:44:02,417
I wouldn't presume.

613
00:44:02,583 --> 00:44:05,333
If you'd like a referral, just say the word.

614
00:44:05,333 --> 00:44:07,667
You have a gift for recognising greatness.

615
00:44:07,875 --> 00:44:08,917
This way.

616
00:44:10,458 --> 00:44:12,750
Actually, I'm so-so at those arts as well.

617
00:44:13,167 --> 00:44:16,542
Especially my calligraphy hideous.

618
00:44:16,542 --> 00:44:17,958
Practice doesn't improve it.

619
00:44:19,042 --> 00:44:20,292
I love writing poetry.

620
00:44:20,750 --> 00:44:21,917
But poetry

621
00:44:22,417 --> 00:44:24,125
anyone can do that.

622
00:44:34,875 --> 00:44:36,833
The successful candidates are "picking flowers".

623
00:44:36,833 --> 00:44:39,042
- Look!
- "Picking flowers"?

624
00:44:39,042 --> 00:44:40,542
It's a custom.

625
00:44:40,542 --> 00:44:41,917
Pass the exams

626
00:44:41,917 --> 00:44:44,542
and you may enter any Chang'an garden

627
00:44:44,542 --> 00:44:45,792
to pick flowers

628
00:44:45,792 --> 00:44:49,625
for tonight's celebrations in Qujiang.

629
00:45:13,500 --> 00:45:15,667
Are you okay?

630
00:45:15,667 --> 00:45:17,375
Pardon me!

631
00:45:21,417 --> 00:45:24,042
That was you with the spear last night.

632
00:45:25,333 --> 00:45:27,375
And it's you!

633
00:45:28,917 --> 00:45:30,083
Thank you, sir.

634
00:45:32,792 --> 00:45:35,750
I'm so sorry. Are you alright?

635
00:45:37,125 --> 00:45:40,167
No problem. Please don't worry.

636
00:45:40,583 --> 00:45:41,458
CHANG JIAN

637
00:45:41,458 --> 00:45:42,708
CHANG JIAN
I'm glad.

638
00:45:42,708 --> 00:45:43,417
CHANG JIAN

639
00:45:46,167 --> 00:45:49,000
Return home a failure, birds and flowers jeer.

640
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:51,792
Better to remain in Chang'an one more year.

641
00:45:54,625 --> 00:45:56,667
Such a coincidence, dear.

642
00:45:56,958 --> 00:46:00,917
We're off to sing at the Qujiang parties.

643
00:46:01,125 --> 00:46:03,875
We didn't expect to meet you here.

644
00:46:04,667 --> 00:46:07,125
The scholar gave the lady a flower.

645
00:46:07,250 --> 00:46:08,917
She'll have a lucky year.

646
00:46:09,500 --> 00:46:10,333
M-miss!

647
00:46:11,750 --> 00:46:13,208
Last night at Prince Qi's residence

648
00:46:13,417 --> 00:46:15,500
what song were you singing?

649
00:46:15,500 --> 00:46:18,083
The lyrics were beautiful.

650
00:46:19,208 --> 00:46:21,083
I learned it a few days ago.

651
00:46:21,167 --> 00:46:22,458
"Gathering Lotuses"

652
00:46:23,208 --> 00:46:26,792
The lyrics are by a brilliant young man.

653
00:46:27,042 --> 00:46:27,958
Li Bai.

654
00:46:28,125 --> 00:46:29,167
Li Bai?

655
00:46:30,208 --> 00:46:32,875
Miss, we need to hurry

656
00:46:32,875 --> 00:46:36,458
we can't be late for the celebrations.

657
00:46:36,583 --> 00:46:38,500
Li Bai.

658
00:46:39,125 --> 00:46:42,667
His fame had already reached Chang'an.

659
00:46:43,125 --> 00:46:45,500
Even a singsong girl knew his name.

660
00:46:46,417 --> 00:46:49,750
Wang Wei, Li Bai, they were right.

661
00:46:50,292 --> 00:46:52,833
Unknowns had no business in Chang'an.

662
00:46:53,125 --> 00:46:54,958
I needed to go elsewhere,

663
00:46:54,958 --> 00:47:00,000
make a name, then come to Chang'an.

664
00:47:00,333 --> 00:47:02,167
So you went home?

665
00:47:03,667 --> 00:47:06,625
Yes, but before I did,

666
00:47:07,292 --> 00:47:11,458
I had an appointment to keep.

667
00:47:12,500 --> 00:47:13,792
You went to Yangzhou?

668
00:47:15,167 --> 00:47:16,833
I went to Yangzhou.

669
00:47:17,625 --> 00:47:21,292
FORT YUNSHAN OUTSKIRTS

670
00:47:26,167 --> 00:47:27,083
Let's go report this!

671
00:47:43,958 --> 00:47:48,000
YANGZHOU

672
00:47:59,917 --> 00:48:01,042
They were from Daming Temple. You owe me!

673
00:48:01,042 --> 00:48:01,708
Miss!
They were from Daming Temple. You owe me!

674
00:48:01,708 --> 00:48:02,917
They were from Daming Temple. You owe me!

675
00:48:06,167 --> 00:48:07,625
Yangzhou

676
00:48:08,167 --> 00:48:11,167
was full of temptation and sweetness.

677
00:48:12,458 --> 00:48:16,625
At the inn there, I asked about Li Bai.

678
00:48:16,833 --> 00:48:18,792
Everyone knew him.

679
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:20,958
Where is he?

680
00:48:21,292 --> 00:48:22,917
Brother Gao!

681
00:48:24,958 --> 00:48:27,208
This is so unexpected!

682
00:48:27,542 --> 00:48:29,833
And so great. I've really missed you!

683
00:48:30,333 --> 00:48:32,083
Brother Li-

684
00:48:32,417 --> 00:48:34,708
we agreed to meet in a year. I kept my word.

685
00:48:35,625 --> 00:48:37,125
We agreed to what?

686
00:48:40,792 --> 00:48:42,625
This fellow, I've told you about him

687
00:48:42,625 --> 00:48:45,292
Dongting Lake, strong as an ox,

688
00:48:45,292 --> 00:48:46,625
felling thieves with one blow.

689
00:48:46,625 --> 00:48:50,083
A Bohai Gao, Gao Shi, Gao Thirty-Five!

690
00:48:51,958 --> 00:48:53,458
You're just in time.

691
00:48:53,458 --> 00:48:55,292
We're about to do something big.

692
00:48:55,458 --> 00:48:56,167
What's that?

693
00:48:56,250 --> 00:48:57,167
We're going to save someone.

694
00:48:57,250 --> 00:48:58,167
Come, come!

695
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:00,750
From the dragon's pool and tiger's lair

696
00:49:00,750 --> 00:49:02,667
we'll rescue a divine beauty!

697
00:49:02,667 --> 00:49:04,833
Dragon's pool, tiger's lair?

698
00:49:09,542 --> 00:49:10,333
Stop there!

699
00:49:38,667 --> 00:49:39,292
Brother Gao

700
00:49:39,542 --> 00:49:41,792
don't you want to see who you saved?

701
00:49:54,042 --> 00:49:55,208
Master Li

702
00:49:55,208 --> 00:49:57,083
I was at Master Su's banquet.

703
00:49:57,083 --> 00:49:58,792
I was only halfway into my dance

704
00:49:58,792 --> 00:50:01,125
when you barged in and stole me away.

705
00:50:01,208 --> 00:50:02,750
Where are you taking me?

706
00:50:02,917 --> 00:50:04,958
Banquet?

707
00:50:05,542 --> 00:50:07,708
Su Sixteen. Such a bore.

708
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:10,667
Dancing for such bores is so dull.

709
00:50:11,083 --> 00:50:13,958
I rescued you from all that tedium.

710
00:50:13,958 --> 00:50:15,750
Shouldn't you thank me?

711
00:50:16,417 --> 00:50:17,792
I thank you.

712
00:50:17,833 --> 00:50:20,417
But my mother won't forgive you.

713
00:50:20,583 --> 00:50:23,875
Whatever. We're off to Master Pei's house.

714
00:50:24,375 --> 00:50:25,750
Master Pei is with you?

715
00:50:27,042 --> 00:50:28,083
Pei Twelve's father

716
00:50:28,083 --> 00:50:29,875
General Pei is hosting a banquet tonight.

717
00:50:30,250 --> 00:50:32,750
Wu Daozi is coming to paint.

718
00:50:32,917 --> 00:50:36,000
The General will do a sword dance to inspire him.

719
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:38,708
Wu Daozi's painting, General Pei's sword-

720
00:50:38,708 --> 00:50:41,333
two treasures of the Tang in one night!

721
00:50:41,458 --> 00:50:44,083
That's what I call a great banquet.

722
00:50:44,125 --> 00:50:45,292
Stop that boat!

723
00:50:45,292 --> 00:50:48,167
She's on that boat! Chase it!

724
00:50:49,708 --> 00:50:52,042
Row faster, faster!

725
00:51:35,750 --> 00:51:38,292
Master Li, don't be angry.

726
00:51:38,583 --> 00:51:40,375
I can't make General Pei's banquet.

727
00:51:40,375 --> 00:51:41,833
That's my bad luck.

728
00:51:42,125 --> 00:51:44,708
What if instead, here on this boat

729
00:51:44,958 --> 00:51:47,792
I show you my new Zhezhi Dance?

730
00:51:48,875 --> 00:51:49,625
Why not.

731
00:51:49,625 --> 00:51:50,208
Great!

732
00:51:50,208 --> 00:51:52,667
Dance! I'll play the drum for you.

733
00:51:53,250 --> 00:51:55,000
Thank you, Master Li.

734
00:52:19,583 --> 00:52:21,167
A beautiful Zhezhi Dance.

735
00:52:22,542 --> 00:52:25,750
A beauty's smile as precious as gold

736
00:52:25,750 --> 00:52:28,917
Rippling her sleeves, she sings an exotic tune.

737
00:52:34,708 --> 00:52:38,000
Master Li, did you like tonight's dance?

738
00:52:38,167 --> 00:52:40,750
It outshone the moon on the river!

739
00:52:41,708 --> 00:52:43,792
Here, this is all the money I have on me.

740
00:52:43,792 --> 00:52:44,917
It's your reward.

741
00:52:49,250 --> 00:52:50,792
Thank you, kind sir.

742
00:52:51,750 --> 00:52:53,375
But

743
00:52:53,542 --> 00:52:55,917
you caused big trouble tonight.

744
00:52:56,292 --> 00:52:59,667
My mother needs comforting too.

745
00:53:00,375 --> 00:53:02,167
Of course, yes!

746
00:53:04,542 --> 00:53:06,792
This ring is white jade from Mt Tian.

747
00:53:07,125 --> 00:53:08,208
Take it!

748
00:53:09,542 --> 00:53:11,500
Thank you so much.

749
00:53:15,958 --> 00:53:19,542
Marvelous dancing, a beautiful night!

750
00:53:20,292 --> 00:53:26,583
Youth is fleeting; age is upon me

751
00:53:27,250 --> 00:53:32,458
Flowers fade; my heart is heavy

752
00:53:32,583 --> 00:53:37,500
I long in dreams; reach for that sun-filled place.

753
00:53:38,917 --> 00:53:39,958
Come!

754
00:53:41,750 --> 00:53:45,292
THE PEI RESIDENCE

755
00:53:46,542 --> 00:53:47,625
Incredible!

756
00:53:47,750 --> 00:53:49,208
I can't see.

757
00:53:49,250 --> 00:53:52,500
We're late, we were delayed on the river.

758
00:53:52,625 --> 00:53:53,875
Let's go to the window.

759
00:54:01,625 --> 00:54:02,917
I've got it!

760
00:54:03,625 --> 00:54:05,292
The Way of calligraphy!

761
00:54:06,542 --> 00:54:07,375
The Way of calligraphy!

762
00:54:07,375 --> 00:54:08,292
ZHANG XU
The Way of calligraphy!

763
00:54:08,292 --> 00:54:09,792
ZHANG XU
I've got it!

764
00:54:09,792 --> 00:54:10,042
ZHANG XU

765
00:54:10,708 --> 00:54:13,750
- The Way of calligraphy!
- Yes, while watching Wu Daozi paint.

766
00:54:13,750 --> 00:54:15,292
Zhang Xu found the Way?

767
00:54:15,542 --> 00:54:17,000
Come, Brother Gao.

768
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:29,042
Bravo!

769
00:54:29,750 --> 00:54:31,208
What luck!

770
00:54:31,667 --> 00:54:33,375
Wonderful!

771
00:54:42,083 --> 00:54:44,500
Only in magnificent Yangzhou

772
00:54:44,500 --> 00:54:45,917
do you find such fabulous parties.

773
00:54:47,042 --> 00:54:48,292
The night is young.

774
00:54:48,292 --> 00:54:50,125
In which songhouse

775
00:54:50,125 --> 00:54:51,667
should we continue the fun?

776
00:54:51,750 --> 00:54:55,333
We'll party til the sun lights the east.

777
00:54:55,750 --> 00:54:59,500
Brother Gao, aren't you coming?

778
00:55:04,208 --> 00:55:06,875
Brother Li, forgive my directness.

779
00:55:08,083 --> 00:55:11,042
But spending money like water

780
00:55:11,667 --> 00:55:13,667
how long can you go on like this?

781
00:55:14,375 --> 00:55:16,208
Won't your incredible talent

782
00:55:16,542 --> 00:55:19,375
dissipate amongst such nightly revels?

783
00:55:22,667 --> 00:55:24,958
Gee, uh...

784
00:55:26,792 --> 00:55:30,708
If not amidst Yangzhou's wine and beauties

785
00:55:31,042 --> 00:55:33,542
where should it dissipate?

786
00:55:34,625 --> 00:55:39,625
A great man aims to serve his country.

787
00:55:40,500 --> 00:55:42,292
Serve the country?

788
00:55:43,042 --> 00:55:45,750
Talent alone means you can serve?

789
00:55:50,375 --> 00:55:52,958
Your family's spear is famous.

790
00:55:53,292 --> 00:55:54,917
Would the talented Master Gao

791
00:55:55,583 --> 00:55:59,542
allow a talentless, common wastral like me

792
00:55:59,792 --> 00:56:01,250
to challenge him to a contest?

793
00:56:02,708 --> 00:56:03,292
My pleasure.

794
00:56:05,667 --> 00:56:06,750
Great!

795
00:56:06,792 --> 00:56:08,750
The Pei Sword and the Gao Spear

796
00:56:08,750 --> 00:56:10,958
both arts perfected on the battlefield.

797
00:56:11,250 --> 00:56:12,958
What a good contest.

798
00:56:13,333 --> 00:56:16,750
Yes, but the Gao Spear

799
00:56:17,250 --> 00:56:19,042
wasn't designed for performance

800
00:56:19,042 --> 00:56:21,833
but for killing enemies.

801
00:56:48,625 --> 00:56:50,458
Bravo!

802
00:57:27,167 --> 00:57:28,417
Bravo!

803
00:57:28,833 --> 00:57:31,375
Dancing or fighting with the sword

804
00:57:31,458 --> 00:57:34,833
it's all related. I understand now!

805
00:57:37,292 --> 00:57:39,208
My father's swordsmanship is stellar

806
00:57:39,208 --> 00:57:40,792
and he's a great military man.

807
00:57:41,500 --> 00:57:42,583
But

808
00:57:42,917 --> 00:57:45,083
Imperial Chancellor Li Linfu

809
00:57:45,542 --> 00:57:47,250
only promotes non-Han generals

810
00:57:47,250 --> 00:57:49,000
while restraining the great Han families.

811
00:57:50,958 --> 00:57:52,167
My father

812
00:57:52,750 --> 00:57:55,250
might be the best swordsman ever

813
00:57:55,875 --> 00:57:57,750
but at home in Yangzhou

814
00:57:58,500 --> 00:58:00,792
he can only use his sword to entertain.

815
00:58:06,958 --> 00:58:07,750
Brother Gao

816
00:58:08,625 --> 00:58:09,625
Did you know

817
00:58:12,083 --> 00:58:13,750
that though my family has boys

818
00:58:14,625 --> 00:58:16,042
only I

819
00:58:16,917 --> 00:58:19,458
am the true inheritor of his art?

820
00:58:22,417 --> 00:58:23,458
And yet

821
00:58:29,750 --> 00:58:32,000
I'm a woman.

822
00:58:35,083 --> 00:58:38,875
No door to serving my country is open to me.

823
00:58:41,292 --> 00:58:43,833
A woman's talent!

824
00:58:46,875 --> 00:58:50,417
Talent! Talent!

825
00:58:54,083 --> 00:58:56,333
Pear blossoms drunk on spring's blush

826
00:58:57,500 --> 00:59:00,333
The verdant stream plucks night's strings

827
00:59:02,167 --> 00:59:04,500
Golden times are fleeting

828
00:59:05,750 --> 00:59:10,375
Storms make gloomy the years.

829
00:59:18,750 --> 00:59:21,542
In Yangzhou, everyone knows her.

830
00:59:21,833 --> 00:59:23,500
An exceptional woman

831
00:59:23,500 --> 00:59:25,083
as fine a poet as a swordswoman.

832
00:59:26,042 --> 00:59:28,750
She dresses like a man. Her father indulges her.

833
00:59:32,500 --> 00:59:35,917
Don't fret losing to Pei Twelve

834
00:59:35,917 --> 00:59:38,375
is nothing to be ashamed of.

835
00:59:39,125 --> 00:59:41,667
Let's go, let's get a drink.

836
00:59:41,667 --> 00:59:42,708
Time for a drink.

837
00:59:48,042 --> 00:59:51,458
Brother Li, it's me who lost.

838
00:59:52,083 --> 00:59:53,583
I'm also aware

839
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:58,417
of my youthful arrogance and over-confidence.

840
01:00:03,375 --> 01:00:06,917
I'm neither learned, nor a great martial artist.

841
01:00:07,583 --> 01:00:09,500
I'll go home, study and practice hard

842
01:00:09,958 --> 01:00:12,417
until the day comes that I'm ready

843
01:00:12,750 --> 01:00:15,042
and on that day I will finally shine!

844
01:00:15,583 --> 01:00:18,125
Brother Li, I take my leave.

845
01:00:19,792 --> 01:00:22,292
But you just got to Yangzhou!

846
01:00:26,417 --> 01:00:29,333
The Great Eagle will soar one day.

847
01:00:33,833 --> 01:00:35,250
Gao Thirty-Five

848
01:00:35,250 --> 01:00:37,708
you just stopped stuttering!

849
01:00:40,875 --> 01:00:42,875
It's true.

850
01:00:42,875 --> 01:00:46,208
I never stuttered again after that.

851
01:00:47,542 --> 01:00:48,708
Reporting!

852
01:00:50,792 --> 01:00:54,042
Sir, it's urgent military news.

853
01:00:55,083 --> 01:00:57,042
The whole Tubo army has left Yunshan.

854
01:00:57,167 --> 01:00:58,708
and is headed towards Lushui Pass.

855
01:00:59,042 --> 01:01:00,125
The whole army?

856
01:01:00,250 --> 01:01:02,333
We saw it ourselves, it's true.

857
01:01:02,708 --> 01:01:03,708
There's cavalry and infantry.

858
01:01:03,708 --> 01:01:05,542
Altogether 70 or 80 thousand.

859
01:01:06,708 --> 01:01:08,750
How far are they from Lushui Pass?

860
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:10,792
Twenty li, about six hours.

861
01:01:11,083 --> 01:01:13,125
Six hours.

862
01:01:18,500 --> 01:01:22,250
Please, sit. We still have time.

863
01:01:32,542 --> 01:01:35,125
LIANG GARDENS
I returned to Liang Gardens in Shangqiu.

864
01:01:35,125 --> 01:01:35,708
LIANG GARDENS

865
01:01:35,708 --> 01:01:37,042
LIANG GARDENS
Our family estate still had some fields

866
01:01:37,042 --> 01:01:39,208
Our family estate still had some fields

867
01:01:39,417 --> 01:01:40,958
and several old houses.

868
01:01:41,750 --> 01:01:44,583
Three years soon passed.

869
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:46,750
It was spring again.

870
01:01:47,042 --> 01:01:55,167
Green woods fringe the village;
verdant mountains surround it.

871
01:01:55,333 --> 01:01:56,500
Brother Gao

872
01:01:56,500 --> 01:01:58,958
why can other people study alone

873
01:01:58,958 --> 01:02:01,125
but I have to read something first

874
01:02:01,125 --> 01:02:02,542
for you to remember it?

875
01:02:12,125 --> 01:02:13,375
Gao Shi

876
01:02:13,750 --> 01:02:15,958
we caught a thief by the village temple.

877
01:02:16,125 --> 01:02:17,917
He says he's your friend!

878
01:02:19,375 --> 01:02:22,125
Brother Gao, long time no see.

879
01:02:22,458 --> 01:02:23,292
Li Bai!

880
01:02:24,292 --> 01:02:26,250
It's true, he's an old friend.

881
01:02:26,250 --> 01:02:27,417
Please, let him go.

882
01:02:27,708 --> 01:02:30,208
He was napping naked in the temple!

883
01:02:30,333 --> 01:02:31,417
He doesn't look respectable.

884
01:02:31,417 --> 01:02:32,250
I apologise.

885
01:02:32,333 --> 01:02:33,625
This friend from afar

886
01:02:33,625 --> 01:02:35,083
is rather casual by nature.

887
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:38,083
- Mr Gao says he's a friend.
- Leave them.

888
01:02:38,750 --> 01:02:41,000
Brother Li, how'd you get here?

889
01:02:45,875 --> 01:02:46,625
Gao Shi

890
01:02:46,875 --> 01:02:49,500
remember I taught you the art of wrestling?

891
01:02:49,500 --> 01:02:50,625
To answer force with feints?

892
01:02:51,208 --> 01:02:53,417
Come, let's have a match.

893
01:03:08,333 --> 01:03:10,500
Gao Shi, you've improved a lot.

894
01:03:26,375 --> 01:03:28,583
You win, Brother Gao.

895
01:03:29,875 --> 01:03:31,000
You look well.

896
01:03:31,250 --> 01:03:34,000
Brother Li, have you been well?

897
01:03:35,542 --> 01:03:37,042
No, I've been wretched.

898
01:03:37,292 --> 01:03:39,542
A few months ago I got very sick

899
01:03:40,167 --> 01:03:41,875
and almost died in Yangzhou.

900
01:03:43,208 --> 01:03:43,958
Forget it!

901
01:03:44,042 --> 01:03:46,000
Come, let's drink. C'mon.

902
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:47,458
Sure.

903
01:03:49,458 --> 01:03:52,125
Happily, I just caught some fish.

904
01:03:52,125 --> 01:03:52,833
They'll go well with wine.

905
01:03:52,833 --> 01:03:55,958
Fishing with straight hooks like Duke Jiang?

906
01:03:56,792 --> 01:03:58,625
He never caught any fish.

907
01:03:58,917 --> 01:04:00,625
But I have.

908
01:04:02,792 --> 01:04:03,833
Cheers.

909
01:04:08,125 --> 01:04:10,500
I'm working hard on my martial skills.

910
01:04:10,958 --> 01:04:14,500
Oh, I'm learning to write poetry too.

911
01:04:14,500 --> 01:04:15,375
I know.

912
01:04:15,917 --> 01:04:18,042
Lonely view of autumn grasses

913
01:04:18,042 --> 01:04:20,583
Bitter winds blow for thousands of miles

914
01:04:20,583 --> 01:04:22,667
You've read my poetry?

915
01:04:23,542 --> 01:04:25,333
People are reading it everywhere.

916
01:04:25,542 --> 01:04:27,875
Brother Gao, your splendid talent

917
01:04:27,958 --> 01:04:29,292
has finally burst forth!

918
01:04:31,208 --> 01:04:32,708
I speak easily now

919
01:04:32,917 --> 01:04:34,708
But studying is still hard for me.

920
01:04:35,167 --> 01:04:37,917
A village student has to read to me

921
01:04:37,917 --> 01:04:39,250
before I can absorb anything.

922
01:04:39,250 --> 01:04:42,292
That's fine. Who cares?

923
01:04:42,708 --> 01:04:44,833
As a boy studying at Elephant Ear Mountain

924
01:04:45,708 --> 01:04:47,333
I never seemed to improve.

925
01:04:47,708 --> 01:04:49,083
One day I skipped class.

926
01:04:49,708 --> 01:04:51,708
Know what I saw by the stream?

927
01:04:52,542 --> 01:04:53,875
An old woman, polishing a rod

928
01:04:53,875 --> 01:04:55,208
of metal this thick.

929
01:04:55,875 --> 01:04:57,583
I asked, what are you doing?

930
01:04:58,000 --> 01:04:59,125
The old woman said

931
01:04:59,125 --> 01:05:02,167
"Effort plus time turns a rod into a needle fine."

932
01:05:03,333 --> 01:05:04,917
So I went back and studied.

933
01:05:05,792 --> 01:05:07,667
Studying is always hard.

934
01:05:07,833 --> 01:05:09,500
You see, I had to work hard too.

935
01:05:11,417 --> 01:05:13,958
Brother Li, is that a true story?

936
01:05:14,833 --> 01:05:16,958
If I tell it of course it's true.

937
01:05:20,458 --> 01:05:23,333
Brother Gao, are you still single?

938
01:05:25,333 --> 01:05:26,667
Poor as I am

939
01:05:26,792 --> 01:05:28,708
and with no hope of an official position,

940
01:05:29,292 --> 01:05:31,958
what family would give me their daughter's hand?

941
01:05:34,583 --> 01:05:36,083
I'm getting married.

942
01:05:37,208 --> 01:05:40,333
Congratulations! What family is she from?

943
01:05:40,333 --> 01:05:41,792
The Xus of Anlu.

944
01:05:43,042 --> 01:05:45,042
Retired Chancellor Xu?

945
01:05:45,167 --> 01:05:45,833
That's right.

946
01:05:46,708 --> 01:05:48,833
I really must congratulate you!

947
01:06:00,625 --> 01:06:03,792
These are the celebrated Liang Gardens?

948
01:06:05,958 --> 01:06:07,167
A thousand years have passed.

949
01:06:07,792 --> 01:06:10,208
Now all that's left is this collapsed wall

950
01:06:10,208 --> 01:06:11,542
and a few ruined pavilions.

951
01:06:13,958 --> 01:06:15,917
Worldly prosperity is an illusion.

952
01:06:15,917 --> 01:06:17,542
Ephemeral as a flower's bloom.

953
01:06:18,583 --> 01:06:19,917
All those years in Yangzhou

954
01:06:20,167 --> 01:06:22,083
passed as though in a dream.

955
01:06:23,667 --> 01:06:25,625
That day when we said goodbye

956
01:06:25,625 --> 01:06:27,583
I received terrible news from home.

957
01:06:29,083 --> 01:06:31,083
My father suffered a sudden illness

958
01:06:31,083 --> 01:06:32,292
and passed away in his prime.

959
01:06:34,125 --> 01:06:36,083
Of all the people in the world

960
01:06:37,375 --> 01:06:38,958
he loved me best.

961
01:06:43,500 --> 01:06:46,292
Before I got home, my brothers split the estate.

962
01:06:46,333 --> 01:06:49,542
They said I'd already frittered away my share.

963
01:06:49,750 --> 01:06:51,500
I didn't get a cent.

964
01:06:52,792 --> 01:06:53,917
Overnight

965
01:06:53,917 --> 01:06:55,292
I found myself

966
01:06:55,292 --> 01:06:57,542
an outcast, persona non grata.

967
01:06:57,917 --> 01:06:58,625
I...

968
01:06:58,958 --> 01:07:00,500
I had no idea.

969
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:03,583
Thrown out of home

970
01:07:03,667 --> 01:07:05,333
I set myself up in a little inn

971
01:07:05,583 --> 01:07:07,958
where I fell suddenly and terribly ill

972
01:07:07,958 --> 01:07:09,417
and nearly died.

973
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:10,875
That night...

974
01:07:17,958 --> 01:07:20,000
Moonlight at the foot of my bed

975
01:07:24,125 --> 01:07:27,917
Appears to me like frost.

976
01:07:32,958 --> 01:07:34,583
Lifting my head, I behold the moon

977
01:07:35,958 --> 01:07:37,208
Lowering it,

978
01:07:45,875 --> 01:07:47,708
I think of home.

979
01:07:52,792 --> 01:07:54,500
I know that poem of yours.

980
01:08:06,500 --> 01:08:07,750
What I was saying

981
01:08:07,750 --> 01:08:09,417
is that I'm done with my prodigal ways.

982
01:08:09,417 --> 01:08:10,542
I'm getting married!

983
01:08:11,833 --> 01:08:13,625
In a month, I'll go to Anlu

984
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:15,375
and pay my respects to the Xus.

985
01:08:15,875 --> 01:08:17,708
They have a courtyard where I can live.

986
01:08:17,917 --> 01:08:19,292
I want to have children.

987
01:08:21,167 --> 01:08:23,000
Though my sons won't bear my surname

988
01:08:23,292 --> 01:08:25,458
the surname Xu

989
01:08:25,667 --> 01:08:27,542
is that of a great and respected family.

990
01:08:27,625 --> 01:08:29,250
You're joining your bride's family?

991
01:08:34,917 --> 01:08:38,208
He said the Xus were a powerful family.

992
01:08:38,750 --> 01:08:40,792
By joining them as a son-in-law

993
01:08:40,875 --> 01:08:44,417
he could change his status

994
01:08:45,500 --> 01:08:49,375
He was the son of a lowly merchant.

995
01:08:49,542 --> 01:08:52,458
For his children to be surnamed Xu

996
01:08:52,458 --> 01:08:53,833
was a good thing.

997
01:08:54,583 --> 01:08:57,000
But I was totally opposed to it.

998
01:08:57,625 --> 01:08:59,375
Taking her family name?

999
01:08:59,708 --> 01:09:03,958
Society disdained men who did that

1000
01:09:03,958 --> 01:09:06,292
In the future how could he face

1001
01:09:06,292 --> 01:09:09,125
his own ancestors?

1002
01:09:09,125 --> 01:09:11,042
It's not far from Xiangyang. Look!

1003
01:09:11,042 --> 01:09:14,542
He asked me to go with him to Xiangyang

1004
01:09:14,875 --> 01:09:16,458
to get some advice.

1005
01:09:16,458 --> 01:09:20,000
If his most respected and trusted friend

1006
01:09:20,667 --> 01:09:22,583
was also against it

1007
01:09:22,583 --> 01:09:25,042
then he'd give up the plan.

1008
01:09:25,375 --> 01:09:28,333
Meng Haoran lives in a wonderland.

1009
01:09:28,625 --> 01:09:31,083
Brother Gao, you'll adore Meng Haoran!

1010
01:09:31,875 --> 01:09:34,333
Meng Haoran.

1011
01:09:35,958 --> 01:09:38,583
Of course I knew his name.

1012
01:09:39,333 --> 01:09:41,542
Deep sleeps of spring

1013
01:09:41,542 --> 01:09:44,125
all around me birds sing.

1014
01:09:46,208 --> 01:09:48,875
A loud stormy night

1015
01:09:48,875 --> 01:09:50,167
countless petals fall.

1016
01:09:50,167 --> 01:09:52,042
MENG RESIDENCE
countless petals fall.

1017
01:09:52,042 --> 01:09:54,750
MENG RESIDENCE

1018
01:09:55,167 --> 01:09:57,250
Master Meng isn't home. He left two days ago.

1019
01:09:57,250 --> 01:09:58,208
He left?

1020
01:09:58,708 --> 01:09:59,625
My Master said

1021
01:09:59,625 --> 01:10:01,750
to tell friends he'd gone to Jiangxia,

1022
01:10:01,750 --> 01:10:03,292
where he'd change boats for Yangzhou.

1023
01:10:03,958 --> 01:10:05,125
I have to catch up with him.

1024
01:10:05,333 --> 01:10:05,917
Brother Li!

1025
01:10:05,917 --> 01:10:07,708
Hurry, we'll race to Jiangxia

1026
01:10:07,708 --> 01:10:09,500
and catch him before his boat leaves.

1027
01:10:11,792 --> 01:10:12,875
This business with the Xus

1028
01:10:12,875 --> 01:10:14,708
I wrote to him about it.

1029
01:10:14,708 --> 01:10:16,833
I'm sure he's going to Yangzhou to see me!

1030
01:10:17,917 --> 01:10:19,917
And so we returned to Jiangxia

1031
01:10:21,167 --> 01:10:22,542
and Yellow Crane Tower.

1032
01:10:24,875 --> 01:10:26,083
Which is the boat for Yangzhou?

1033
01:10:26,125 --> 01:10:27,125
The boat to Yangzhou

1034
01:10:27,125 --> 01:10:28,583
just set sail.

1035
01:10:30,583 --> 01:10:31,667
Brother Li!

1036
01:10:51,750 --> 01:10:52,750
Brother Li!

1037
01:10:54,958 --> 01:10:56,375
Mr Meng!

1038
01:10:56,833 --> 01:10:58,250
Mr Meng!

1039
01:11:00,625 --> 01:11:02,125
The advice I asked for

1040
01:11:02,125 --> 01:11:04,542
should I do it or not?

1041
01:11:08,333 --> 01:11:10,792
The sound of the wind muffled his answer.

1042
01:11:11,250 --> 01:11:12,958
Mr Meng!

1043
01:11:17,083 --> 01:11:18,792
Mr Meng!

1044
01:11:32,125 --> 01:11:34,667
Brother Gao, I need your strength!

1045
01:11:39,125 --> 01:11:41,542
YES OR NO

1046
01:11:59,417 --> 01:12:03,667
YES

1047
01:12:33,125 --> 01:12:34,292
Waiter!

1048
01:12:34,667 --> 01:12:36,208
Give me brush and ink.

1049
01:12:36,500 --> 01:12:37,792
I want to write a poem!

1050
01:12:39,875 --> 01:12:42,958
Okay, sir, let me go.

1051
01:12:53,958 --> 01:12:56,667
The lone boat slowly vanishes against the sky

1052
01:12:57,167 --> 01:13:00,708
I see only the Yangtze flowing
to the edge of the world.

1053
01:13:01,083 --> 01:13:02,250
Waiter

1054
01:13:02,708 --> 01:13:03,917
these excellent lines of mine.

1055
01:13:03,917 --> 01:13:06,125
How do they compare with Cui Hao's?

1056
01:13:06,500 --> 01:13:07,750
Very fine, very fine.

1057
01:13:07,750 --> 01:13:10,208
It's just that, it's a bit short.

1058
01:13:10,208 --> 01:13:11,417
Only four lines.

1059
01:13:11,417 --> 01:13:13,458
Master Cui's poem is eight lines.

1060
01:13:13,958 --> 01:13:18,042
What's length have to do with quality?

1061
01:13:18,583 --> 01:13:20,875
Brother Gao

1062
01:13:20,875 --> 01:13:23,500
I was just overcome with inspiration.

1063
01:13:27,375 --> 01:13:33,208
NO

1064
01:13:42,750 --> 01:13:44,875
After parting that day

1065
01:13:44,958 --> 01:13:47,042
more years fled past.

1066
01:13:48,125 --> 01:13:49,875
I decided to join the army.

1067
01:13:52,208 --> 01:13:54,417
I'm awkward in company.

1068
01:13:54,417 --> 01:13:56,625
I didn't have Li Bai's ease

1069
01:13:56,625 --> 01:14:00,500
or his and Wang Wei's immense talent.

1070
01:14:01,500 --> 01:14:03,917
We Gaos have always been military men.

1071
01:14:04,500 --> 01:14:07,583
It's in braving danger we make our name.

1072
01:14:08,042 --> 01:14:11,000
That's the Gao family's destiny.

1073
01:14:19,000 --> 01:14:23,542
JIZHOU, NORTH OF THE GREAT WALL

1074
01:14:25,667 --> 01:14:27,458
You're known for your literary talent.

1075
01:14:27,458 --> 01:14:31,042
Why not stay and be a military secretary

1076
01:14:31,917 --> 01:14:34,583
ZHANG SHOUGUI
instead of leaving to lead a tiny cavalry?

1077
01:14:34,708 --> 01:14:35,500
General-

1078
01:14:35,708 --> 01:14:36,583
The districts of Andong

1079
01:14:36,583 --> 01:14:38,667
were where my grandfather fought 30 years ago.

1080
01:14:38,833 --> 01:14:41,458
Not to follow his example would bring dishonor.

1081
01:14:41,667 --> 01:14:44,708
I must put on my armor and do battle.

1082
01:14:47,208 --> 01:14:48,292
Come.

1083
01:14:48,875 --> 01:14:52,208
This man leads a frontline cavalry.

1084
01:14:52,250 --> 01:14:54,917
If you win, I'll give you your own cavalry.

1085
01:14:54,917 --> 01:14:55,625
Okay.

1086
01:14:55,917 --> 01:14:56,958
What are we competing in?

1087
01:14:57,500 --> 01:14:59,000
Wrestling.

1088
01:15:03,917 --> 01:15:05,417
Good choice!

1089
01:15:05,667 --> 01:15:07,417
Our opponents are Khitans.

1090
01:15:07,417 --> 01:15:09,500
They're renowned wrestlers.

1091
01:15:10,917 --> 01:15:13,083
Fine. Let's wrestle.

1092
01:15:43,167 --> 01:15:45,375
Bravo!

1093
01:15:45,375 --> 01:15:46,208
Well done!

1094
01:15:47,042 --> 01:15:48,750
You're a worthy heir to the Gaos.

1095
01:15:48,750 --> 01:15:49,250
AUTHORISED

1096
01:15:52,458 --> 01:15:55,167
TANG

1097
01:15:58,583 --> 01:16:00,417
Captain Gao!

1098
01:16:03,583 --> 01:16:05,542
That whole year in Jizhou

1099
01:16:09,417 --> 01:16:11,500
I didn't write a single poem.

1100
01:16:17,667 --> 01:16:19,125
The Khitan army is on the move!

1101
01:16:23,333 --> 01:16:26,333
I was ordered to locate the Khitans.

1102
01:16:29,375 --> 01:16:31,208
For months

1103
01:16:31,833 --> 01:16:34,750
we found no trace of them.

1104
01:16:34,875 --> 01:16:36,833
There! Over there!

1105
01:16:50,000 --> 01:16:51,667
The Khitans are burning the plains!

1106
01:16:54,167 --> 01:16:56,000
Retreat!

1107
01:17:06,500 --> 01:17:07,958
Orders from the General：

1108
01:17:07,958 --> 01:17:09,875
A cavalry platoon of the Right Army

1109
01:17:09,875 --> 01:17:11,125
twelve li to the northwest

1110
01:17:11,125 --> 01:17:12,500
has been ambushed by a river.

1111
01:17:12,500 --> 01:17:14,042
We need to relieve the siege now!

1112
01:17:14,917 --> 01:17:17,292
All soldiers mobilize!

1113
01:17:52,917 --> 01:17:54,333
From start to finish

1114
01:17:55,000 --> 01:17:57,792
we never found the Khitans' main forces.

1115
01:18:01,000 --> 01:18:03,625
The next order I received

1116
01:18:03,625 --> 01:18:06,167
was to retreat and hold our position.

1117
01:18:07,042 --> 01:18:07,917
A retreat

1118
01:18:07,917 --> 01:18:10,125
- Dismount!
- is far more dangerous

1119
01:18:10,250 --> 01:18:12,042
than an advance.

1120
01:18:45,000 --> 01:18:45,917
Beautiful!

1121
01:18:59,708 --> 01:19:01,250
Gao Thirty-five

1122
01:19:02,125 --> 01:19:03,333
The Jizhou army

1123
01:19:03,333 --> 01:19:05,750
isn't a place for you.

1124
01:19:06,958 --> 01:19:08,292
Go home.

1125
01:19:28,292 --> 01:19:33,875
PUJINYI INN

1126
01:19:54,417 --> 01:19:56,333
Those soldiers are off to Longxi.

1127
01:19:56,792 --> 01:19:58,750
Their hair is whiter than mine

1128
01:19:58,750 --> 01:20:00,708
and they still can't shed their armor.

1129
01:20:02,792 --> 01:20:04,500
Is that the inn's poetry pavilion?

1130
01:20:05,542 --> 01:20:07,667
Wherever they're from, poets

1131
01:20:07,875 --> 01:20:10,042
like to leave a little something here.

1132
01:20:11,000 --> 01:20:12,625
Want to write a poem?

1133
01:20:13,542 --> 01:20:15,083
There's charcoal by the wall.

1134
01:20:49,792 --> 01:20:50,833
I...

1135
01:20:51,542 --> 01:20:53,708
wrote poetry again.

1136
01:20:55,333 --> 01:20:59,208
O'er the northeast rises the smoke
and dust of battle

1137
01:20:59,417 --> 01:21:03,625
The Han fight the fierce enemy far from home

1138
01:21:04,042 --> 01:21:07,458
The men vanquish all before them.

1139
01:21:08,458 --> 01:21:09,167
Gao Shi.

1140
01:21:09,625 --> 01:21:10,333
Hey.

1141
01:21:10,333 --> 01:21:11,250
Gao Shi.

1142
01:21:11,250 --> 01:21:12,417
Gao Thirty-five.

1143
01:21:14,500 --> 01:21:15,292
Gao Shi.

1144
01:21:15,917 --> 01:21:16,750
Who's there?

1145
01:21:18,750 --> 01:21:19,792
Me!

1146
01:21:20,458 --> 01:21:21,375
Brother Li?

1147
01:21:21,708 --> 01:21:22,708
Brother Li?

1148
01:21:29,417 --> 01:21:31,625
Brother Li! What are you doing here?

1149
01:21:32,750 --> 01:21:33,958
Brother Gao, ah, Brother Gao

1150
01:21:34,208 --> 01:21:35,792
I never imagined meeting you here.

1151
01:21:36,500 --> 01:21:38,375
I just saw on that poetry board

1152
01:21:38,375 --> 01:21:40,167
quite by accident the poem you wrote.

1153
01:21:40,167 --> 01:21:42,417
I asked and it's true, you're here!

1154
01:21:44,208 --> 01:21:45,333
Brother Li, you...

1155
01:21:45,625 --> 01:21:46,875
why are you dressed like that?

1156
01:21:49,667 --> 01:21:51,083
I'm fleeing for my life.

1157
01:21:52,625 --> 01:21:53,667
That new poem of yours-

1158
01:21:53,708 --> 01:21:54,667
Gao Shi

1159
01:21:54,958 --> 01:21:56,542
it's the best one you've ever written.

1160
01:21:56,542 --> 01:21:57,542
Congratulations!

1161
01:21:58,000 --> 01:22:00,708
While in cruel battle soldiers die

1162
01:22:01,167 --> 01:22:03,417
In the general's tent, beauties dance

1163
01:22:03,833 --> 01:22:06,667
Young wives down south weep, comfortless

1164
01:22:07,000 --> 01:22:10,000
The men marching north gaze back at emptiness

1165
01:22:10,542 --> 01:22:11,750
Gao Thirty-five

1166
01:22:11,750 --> 01:22:14,833
these lines will live forever!

1167
01:22:15,792 --> 01:22:17,417
Brother Li, you're too kind.

1168
01:22:18,125 --> 01:22:20,833
Brother Li, why are you on the run?

1169
01:22:22,125 --> 01:22:23,750
It's a long story.

1170
01:22:26,042 --> 01:22:27,875
Years ago, after we parted at Yellow Crane Tower

1171
01:22:27,875 --> 01:22:29,667
I went to Anlu.

1172
01:22:31,417 --> 01:22:34,167
Later my father-in-law died.

1173
01:22:34,167 --> 01:22:35,792
He'd raised a younger relative

1174
01:22:35,792 --> 01:22:37,125
as his heir.

1175
01:22:38,750 --> 01:22:40,417
He pushed me aside.

1176
01:22:42,375 --> 01:22:43,875
Didn't you warn me

1177
01:22:43,875 --> 01:22:45,333
not to join my wife's family?

1178
01:22:49,667 --> 01:22:51,375
One day Master Danqiu came by.

1179
01:22:52,042 --> 01:22:53,125
He'd entered a Taoist order.

1180
01:22:53,125 --> 01:22:54,417
He's an old friend from home.

1181
01:22:55,000 --> 01:22:56,500
Have you heard of him?

1182
01:22:56,625 --> 01:22:57,500
Of course.

1183
01:22:58,500 --> 01:23:00,250
A Great Eagle can't fit in a finch's nest!

1184
01:23:00,542 --> 01:23:02,208
So I left Anlu

1185
01:23:02,750 --> 01:23:04,542
and travelled with Master Danqiu

1186
01:23:04,583 --> 01:23:05,708
seeking the Way to immortality.

1187
01:23:05,708 --> 01:23:06,042
MASTER DANQIU
seeking the Way to immortality.

1188
01:23:06,042 --> 01:23:07,750
MASTER DANQIU

1189
01:23:07,750 --> 01:23:08,958
MASTER DANQIU
It's not something that comes quickly.

1190
01:23:08,958 --> 01:23:10,167
It's not something that comes quickly.

1191
01:23:12,708 --> 01:23:14,917
A friend in the Youzhou Army

1192
01:23:14,917 --> 01:23:16,000
invited me to visit.

1193
01:23:17,167 --> 01:23:18,167
Maybe

1194
01:23:18,625 --> 01:23:21,000
I could serve the Tang on the frontier.

1195
01:23:22,250 --> 01:23:23,167
As a result,

1196
01:23:23,417 --> 01:23:25,333
guess what I discovered?

1197
01:23:26,167 --> 01:23:27,625
An Lushan

1198
01:23:28,542 --> 01:23:30,208
was planning a rebellion.

1199
01:23:31,750 --> 01:23:33,708
Governor An Lushan

1200
01:23:33,708 --> 01:23:35,792
is the Tang's most trusted general on the borders.

1201
01:23:35,958 --> 01:23:37,292
That's a capital crime!

1202
01:23:37,667 --> 01:23:38,792
Do you have proof?

1203
01:23:39,042 --> 01:23:40,000
Yes.

1204
01:23:41,625 --> 01:23:43,083
That day I went to a tailor

1205
01:23:43,083 --> 01:23:44,833
to pick up my robe.

1206
01:23:44,833 --> 01:23:46,333
This one.

1207
01:23:46,750 --> 01:23:47,625
The tailor made a mistake.

1208
01:23:47,625 --> 01:23:48,917
He gave me the wrong robe-

1209
01:23:48,958 --> 01:23:50,208
an official one.

1210
01:23:50,458 --> 01:23:52,125
But not one of the Tang!

1211
01:23:52,208 --> 01:23:54,208
I didn't think much about it at the time.

1212
01:23:54,208 --> 01:23:55,875
I returned the robe.

1213
01:23:56,000 --> 01:23:57,417
But as it turned out

1214
01:24:03,208 --> 01:24:05,875
I went for a stroll that afternoon

1215
01:24:06,250 --> 01:24:07,542
and passing the tailor's on my way back

1216
01:24:08,125 --> 01:24:09,167
saw that his shop

1217
01:24:09,167 --> 01:24:10,958
was in flames. Nothing was left.

1218
01:24:11,542 --> 01:24:12,958
I was deciding what to do

1219
01:24:12,958 --> 01:24:14,625
when my friend rushed over

1220
01:24:14,833 --> 01:24:16,125
and warned me not to go home

1221
01:24:16,125 --> 01:24:17,292
but to flee immediately.

1222
01:24:17,375 --> 01:24:18,542
The tailor and his apprentices

1223
01:24:18,542 --> 01:24:20,833
were arrested by the governor's personal guards

1224
01:24:20,833 --> 01:24:22,292
and executed.

1225
01:24:23,417 --> 01:24:25,917
As I left the city, the gates shut.

1226
01:24:27,042 --> 01:24:28,417
and the whole way here

1227
01:24:28,417 --> 01:24:29,250
I noticed

1228
01:24:29,417 --> 01:24:31,000
soldiers on my tail.

1229
01:24:31,583 --> 01:24:32,792
I need to report to the court.

1230
01:24:33,292 --> 01:24:34,125
I'm sure

1231
01:24:34,417 --> 01:24:35,625
that official robe

1232
01:24:35,792 --> 01:24:37,792
was part of the rebel An Lushan's plans

1233
01:24:38,208 --> 01:24:39,167
to form his own court!

1234
01:24:39,792 --> 01:24:41,458
This is a very grave matter.

1235
01:24:41,500 --> 01:24:42,542
But the court won't believe

1236
01:24:42,542 --> 01:24:44,500
the words of a commoner.

1237
01:24:44,708 --> 01:24:46,792
I have to find an official

1238
01:24:46,958 --> 01:24:48,250
who'll speak to the Court for me.

1239
01:24:48,250 --> 01:24:49,250
and report the situation.

1240
01:24:49,833 --> 01:24:51,667
Everyone who tries, dies.

1241
01:24:51,667 --> 01:24:52,833
It's damn useless.

1242
01:24:52,833 --> 01:24:53,500
Who's there?

1243
01:24:56,833 --> 01:24:58,208
An Lushan's ambitions

1244
01:24:58,417 --> 01:25:00,042
are well known in the borderlands.

1245
01:25:00,375 --> 01:25:02,792
But Li Linfu needs An Lushan and Shi Siming

1246
01:25:02,792 --> 01:25:04,625
as allies in court.

1247
01:25:04,625 --> 01:25:05,875
As for the emperor

1248
01:25:05,875 --> 01:25:06,708
he's getting old

1249
01:25:06,708 --> 01:25:08,292
and doesn't like trouble.

1250
01:25:08,875 --> 01:25:10,750
So what's the point of reporting?

1251
01:25:12,083 --> 01:25:13,333
Please, who are you?

1252
01:25:15,583 --> 01:25:17,000
You

1253
01:25:17,167 --> 01:25:19,458
Li Bai, Gao Shi-

1254
01:25:20,667 --> 01:25:22,583
I've heard of you both.

1255
01:25:22,875 --> 01:25:24,083
You're poets.

1256
01:25:24,083 --> 01:25:25,417
You've heard of me?

1257
01:25:27,458 --> 01:25:28,708
Quick, down!

1258
01:25:32,792 --> 01:25:33,833
They found me!

1259
01:25:34,875 --> 01:25:36,792
But if everyone knows about it

1260
01:25:36,792 --> 01:25:38,500
why do they still want to kill me?

1261
01:25:38,958 --> 01:25:40,292
That official robe

1262
01:25:40,292 --> 01:25:41,125
maybe they're not ready

1263
01:25:41,125 --> 01:25:42,708
for people to find out.

1264
01:26:10,542 --> 01:26:13,375
Li Bai, come out.

1265
01:26:14,125 --> 01:26:15,000
If you don't

1266
01:26:15,000 --> 01:26:17,125
we'll burn the place down.

1267
01:26:21,125 --> 01:26:23,708
Li Bai, those poems of yours

1268
01:26:23,958 --> 01:26:24,958
I like them.

1269
01:26:26,917 --> 01:26:28,042
You out there

1270
01:26:28,042 --> 01:26:29,667
An Lushan's men, right?

1271
01:26:36,083 --> 01:26:37,333
Who are you?

1272
01:26:39,000 --> 01:26:40,708
I'm Guo Ziyi.

1273
01:26:41,042 --> 01:26:42,417
GUO ZIYI
Serving general under Geshu Han,

1274
01:26:42,417 --> 01:26:44,875
GUO ZIYI
Govenor of Longyou.

1275
01:26:44,875 --> 01:26:45,083
GUO ZIYI

1276
01:26:45,417 --> 01:26:46,542
Guo Ziyi?

1277
01:26:47,125 --> 01:26:48,792
Surprised to see you here.

1278
01:26:49,542 --> 01:26:52,458
You're meddling in the Pinglu Army's affairs now?

1279
01:26:54,583 --> 01:26:55,917
Yes.

1280
01:26:56,333 --> 01:26:58,667
I have a houseful of men here

1281
01:26:58,667 --> 01:26:59,500
who thanks to your noise

1282
01:26:59,500 --> 01:27:01,583
can't get a good night's sleep.

1283
01:27:01,583 --> 01:27:03,458
So it's all of our business.

1284
01:27:20,917 --> 01:27:24,500
Guo Ziyi, your great reputation
precedes you. Great skills.

1285
01:27:24,875 --> 01:27:26,958
Since you want to deal with this

1286
01:27:27,333 --> 01:27:30,333
the Longyou army will owe us one.

1287
01:27:30,333 --> 01:27:33,208
You'll pay for this one day.

1288
01:27:33,708 --> 01:27:35,000
Let's go.

1289
01:27:56,583 --> 01:27:58,833
So, before the sun sets

1290
01:27:58,833 --> 01:28:01,292
they're going to execute you at the inn?

1291
01:28:02,875 --> 01:28:04,250
The empire is in trouble.

1292
01:28:04,458 --> 01:28:06,083
The country needs men like you

1293
01:28:06,083 --> 01:28:07,708
brave and strategic.

1294
01:28:07,708 --> 01:28:08,417
How can it be that

1295
01:28:08,417 --> 01:28:10,333
a fire breaks out in a military camp

1296
01:28:10,333 --> 01:28:12,542
and you get blamed and beheaded!

1297
01:28:13,208 --> 01:28:14,917
Military discipline is harsh.

1298
01:28:15,167 --> 01:28:17,042
I've executed others in the past

1299
01:28:17,167 --> 01:28:18,542
today it's my turn.

1300
01:28:19,042 --> 01:28:20,042
Heaven decrees it.

1301
01:28:23,042 --> 01:28:24,125
But it's wrong!

1302
01:28:24,125 --> 01:28:25,542
Heaven gave us these gifts

1303
01:28:25,542 --> 01:28:27,000
surely our day will come!

1304
01:28:34,458 --> 01:28:35,583
When I arrived yesterday

1305
01:28:35,583 --> 01:28:38,125
I heard Geshu Han was leading his army west.

1306
01:28:38,125 --> 01:28:40,083
They're half a day's march away.

1307
01:28:40,750 --> 01:28:43,167
Sir Geshu is an old friend of my family.

1308
01:28:43,667 --> 01:28:45,083
I'll go plead with him.

1309
01:28:48,250 --> 01:28:51,375
Do all you can to protect Brother Guo.

1310
01:28:51,583 --> 01:28:53,792
I'll be back before sunset!

1311
01:28:54,333 --> 01:28:55,417
Hurry.

1312
01:29:32,958 --> 01:29:34,292
Move!

1313
01:29:55,250 --> 01:29:57,667
Stop the execution!

1314
01:30:04,833 --> 01:30:06,417
So the two of you

1315
01:30:06,417 --> 01:30:08,583
together saved Guo Ziyi's life.

1316
01:30:09,250 --> 01:30:12,042
Such a talented man

1317
01:30:12,042 --> 01:30:14,208
shouldn't die a wrongful death.

1318
01:30:15,583 --> 01:30:18,083
Who could've guessed

1319
01:30:18,083 --> 01:30:20,042
that later, he'd suppress An Lushan's rebellion

1320
01:30:20,125 --> 01:30:21,917
and restore the Tang?

1321
01:30:22,542 --> 01:30:25,625
No one could've known.

1322
01:30:36,333 --> 01:30:37,292
Brother Gao,

1323
01:30:37,542 --> 01:30:39,250
How'd you persuade Geshu Han?

1324
01:30:40,708 --> 01:30:41,792
It wasn't too hard.

1325
01:30:42,583 --> 01:30:45,125
He wanted me to work for him.

1326
01:30:45,125 --> 01:30:46,667
I said that in the future

1327
01:30:46,667 --> 01:30:48,583
wherever he led his troops into battle

1328
01:30:48,833 --> 01:30:50,792
he just had to call for me

1329
01:30:50,917 --> 01:30:52,583
and I'd serve him as secretary.

1330
01:30:53,250 --> 01:30:54,583
But you never wanted

1331
01:30:54,583 --> 01:30:56,417
a desk job, right?

1332
01:30:57,625 --> 01:30:58,958
I still don't.

1333
01:31:00,000 --> 01:31:02,333
I give myself ten years.

1334
01:31:05,125 --> 01:31:06,708
Ten years.

1335
01:31:07,750 --> 01:31:11,125
Gao Shi, the first time we met

1336
01:31:11,125 --> 01:31:12,750
was ten years ago, yes?

1337
01:31:13,792 --> 01:31:15,000
Yes.

1338
01:31:15,250 --> 01:31:16,917
Ten years.

1339
01:31:17,500 --> 01:31:18,667
Right.

1340
01:31:19,042 --> 01:31:21,000
I'll also give myself ten years.

1341
01:31:21,000 --> 01:31:22,583
Let's see if in ten years

1342
01:31:22,583 --> 01:31:24,875
we can make it into the court.

1343
01:31:25,917 --> 01:31:27,250
I take my leave

1344
01:31:27,250 --> 01:31:28,542
Gao Shi-

1345
01:31:30,500 --> 01:31:33,917
Hard is the journey, hard is the journey

1346
01:31:34,542 --> 01:31:37,250
So many forks in the road, which is the true one?

1347
01:31:37,917 --> 01:31:40,458
One day the wind and waves will favor me

1348
01:31:41,417 --> 01:31:44,958
I'll raise white sails and head to sea.

1349
01:31:56,917 --> 01:31:58,500
Gao Thirty-Five

1350
01:31:58,583 --> 01:32:00,000
you're back!

1351
01:32:06,250 --> 01:32:08,417
Still want me to read to you?

1352
01:32:08,417 --> 01:32:09,750
Have you made progress?

1353
01:32:11,250 --> 01:32:13,542
Not really, I still need you!

1354
01:32:15,083 --> 01:32:16,417
Great!

1355
01:32:18,250 --> 01:32:20,417
LIANG GARDENS

1356
01:32:20,417 --> 01:32:24,125
LIANG GARDENS
Liang Gardens were even more of a ruins.

1357
01:32:24,125 --> 01:32:25,750
Liang Gardens were even more of a ruins.

1358
01:32:28,667 --> 01:32:30,500
I never imagined that the poem I wrote at Pujinyi Inn

1359
01:32:30,500 --> 01:32:32,667
in a rush of indignation

1360
01:32:32,833 --> 01:32:34,292
would spread wide and far.

1361
01:32:36,667 --> 01:32:38,708
From then on everyone knew

1362
01:32:38,708 --> 01:32:41,167
that I, Gao Shi, was a poet.

1363
01:32:44,167 --> 01:32:46,917
What's more, after years of effort

1364
01:32:47,583 --> 01:32:50,208
I could finally study on my own.

1365
01:32:53,833 --> 01:32:56,458
But, the poem's fame

1366
01:32:56,458 --> 01:32:57,958
made the general I spoke of

1367
01:32:57,958 --> 01:33:01,750
the one with the dancing girls furious.

1368
01:33:01,875 --> 01:33:03,917
And caused all the high officials

1369
01:33:03,917 --> 01:33:06,500
to avoid me like the plague.

1370
01:33:07,083 --> 01:33:08,792
What they wanted

1371
01:33:08,792 --> 01:33:10,917
were people to flatter them.

1372
01:33:10,917 --> 01:33:12,250
Not a literary man

1373
01:33:12,250 --> 01:33:15,375
who could ruin their reputation.

1374
01:33:16,417 --> 01:33:18,417
A literary man.

1375
01:33:40,875 --> 01:33:43,125
Back home in Shangqiu,

1376
01:33:44,708 --> 01:33:47,250
ten years slipped past.

1377
01:33:56,875 --> 01:33:58,292
Gao Thirty-Five

1378
01:33:58,292 --> 01:33:59,917
I hope you've been well...

1379
01:34:00,667 --> 01:34:02,583
Li Bai wrote to me.

1380
01:34:03,833 --> 01:34:07,542
In ten years searching for immortality and the Tao

1381
01:34:07,875 --> 01:34:09,417
he found neither.

1382
01:34:09,417 --> 01:34:11,792
His fame, however, had grown.

1383
01:34:12,000 --> 01:34:15,042
Out of the blue came an imperial summons

1384
01:34:15,167 --> 01:34:16,750
and he was called to Chang'an.

1385
01:34:17,125 --> 01:34:19,375
As a member of the Hanlin Academy

1386
01:34:19,542 --> 01:34:21,875
he won the emperor's admiration.

1387
01:34:22,500 --> 01:34:24,458
His Majesty Xuanzong believed in the Tao.

1388
01:34:25,333 --> 01:34:26,667
Li Bai said

1389
01:34:26,708 --> 01:34:28,375
the one who recommended him to the court

1390
01:34:28,583 --> 01:34:31,000
was Princess Yuzhen.

1391
01:34:31,292 --> 01:34:32,042
Oh?

1392
01:34:33,625 --> 01:34:35,417
Who'd imagine

1393
01:34:35,625 --> 01:34:38,708
Princess Yuzhen would recommend Li Bai!

1394
01:34:39,250 --> 01:34:41,500
By then she had converted to Taoism.

1395
01:34:41,708 --> 01:34:44,583
She adored Taoists, unworldly people.

1396
01:34:48,042 --> 01:34:50,208
Unworldly people.

1397
01:34:51,750 --> 01:34:53,042
He

1398
01:34:53,167 --> 01:34:56,167
finally found the shortcut to the court.

1399
01:34:56,792 --> 01:34:59,042
He invited me to Chang'an.

1400
01:34:59,417 --> 01:35:02,958
He said he had many friends there.

1401
01:35:02,958 --> 01:35:05,708
In court and beyond, everyone loved him.

1402
01:35:06,708 --> 01:35:10,500
He wanted to help me make my mark.

1403
01:35:10,875 --> 01:35:13,333
Hurry, come to Chang'an, don't delay!

1404
01:35:20,417 --> 01:35:25,917
CHANG'AN

1405
01:35:29,792 --> 01:35:31,917
Excuse me, sir

1406
01:35:32,000 --> 01:35:33,375
how can I get to Longevity Hall?

1407
01:35:33,375 --> 01:35:35,750
Mr Li is truly an unbridled genius.

1408
01:35:35,917 --> 01:35:39,417
I toss back my head, laugh at the sky;
we will not stay down for long.

1409
01:35:39,417 --> 01:35:42,333
Beautiful line. Peerless!

1410
01:35:42,875 --> 01:35:44,000
How about

1411
01:35:44,000 --> 01:35:46,500
Ziyang the Immortal, asks me to play my jade flute

1412
01:35:46,583 --> 01:35:48,792
Such a free spirit!

1413
01:35:49,333 --> 01:35:50,500
Excuse me

1414
01:35:50,500 --> 01:35:52,750
is this Li Bai's home?

1415
01:35:52,750 --> 01:35:54,917
Yes, he lives here.

1416
01:35:55,167 --> 01:35:56,792
Are you a fan, too?

1417
01:35:56,792 --> 01:35:58,708
Every day, his fans come

1418
01:35:58,708 --> 01:35:59,875
to gather here.

1419
01:35:59,875 --> 01:36:01,125
It's quite a scene.

1420
01:36:01,458 --> 01:36:03,417
Gao Thirty-Five?

1421
01:36:05,750 --> 01:36:08,458
It's been ages, ages!

1422
01:36:08,708 --> 01:36:09,917
And you, my good man, are...?

1423
01:36:10,958 --> 01:36:13,000
Twenty years ago, at Prince Qi's residence

1424
01:36:13,042 --> 01:36:15,208
we hid together inside a lion.

1425
01:36:15,417 --> 01:36:16,833
I'm Du Fu!

1426
01:36:18,417 --> 01:36:20,917
DU FU

1427
01:36:23,208 --> 01:36:24,708
So it's you!

1428
01:36:25,542 --> 01:36:26,833
This is wonderful.

1429
01:36:27,125 --> 01:36:29,583
I've been reading your poems in recent years.

1430
01:36:29,583 --> 01:36:31,583
Everyone loves your border poem

1431
01:36:31,917 --> 01:36:33,458
But my favourite is your line

1432
01:36:33,750 --> 01:36:36,750
Fresh breezes blow for thousands of miles;
a traveler sails home on the river.

1433
01:36:37,000 --> 01:36:38,417
So free and elegant!

1434
01:36:38,875 --> 01:36:40,125
You're too kind.

1435
01:36:40,375 --> 01:36:40,667
Your

1436
01:36:40,667 --> 01:36:41,750
One must ascend the highest peak

1437
01:36:41,750 --> 01:36:43,167
to see how small the mountains are

1438
01:36:43,167 --> 01:36:44,833
expresses such lofty ideals.

1439
01:36:46,542 --> 01:36:47,875
Are you here to see Li Bai too?

1440
01:36:48,333 --> 01:36:50,208
Yes. I knocked but no one answered.

1441
01:36:50,208 --> 01:36:52,458
He hasn't been home for days.

1442
01:36:52,458 --> 01:36:54,208
He's quite a drinker!

1443
01:36:54,333 --> 01:36:57,750
He'll be at the Qujiang wineshop
where exotic beauties

1444
01:36:57,750 --> 01:36:58,875
perform new songs and dances.

1445
01:36:59,125 --> 01:37:00,042
Come, let's go.

1446
01:37:00,042 --> 01:37:01,792
We'll look for him together.

1447
01:37:04,750 --> 01:37:06,000
Qujiang Pool!

1448
01:37:06,250 --> 01:37:08,000
The year's scholar parties are over

1449
01:37:08,000 --> 01:37:09,375
but the wine shops

1450
01:37:09,375 --> 01:37:11,208
still do a roaring trade.

1451
01:37:11,667 --> 01:37:14,042
Brother Du, are you preparing for the exams?

1452
01:37:15,167 --> 01:37:16,333
I've tested twice

1453
01:37:16,333 --> 01:37:17,375
but didn't make it.

1454
01:37:17,792 --> 01:37:19,042
My own Qujiang party

1455
01:37:19,458 --> 01:37:20,792
will have to wait.

1456
01:37:22,625 --> 01:37:23,833
Here we are.

1457
01:37:50,208 --> 01:37:51,042
Over there!

1458
01:37:51,042 --> 01:37:51,917
Inspector He!

1459
01:37:52,000 --> 01:37:53,375
Inspector He!

1460
01:37:55,208 --> 01:37:56,042
Inspector He!

1461
01:37:56,333 --> 01:37:58,667
Inspector He is fine.

1462
01:37:58,667 --> 01:38:03,000
See? Sound asleep in the pool!

1463
01:38:03,000 --> 01:38:03,458
HE ZHIZHANG
See? Sound asleep in the pool!

1464
01:38:03,458 --> 01:38:06,042
HE ZHIZHANG

1465
01:38:08,958 --> 01:38:11,500
Hurry, Li Bai is up there now!

1466
01:38:11,583 --> 01:38:12,000
What was Inspector He's line?

1467
01:38:12,000 --> 01:38:14,125
ZHANG XU
What was Inspector He's line?

1468
01:38:14,125 --> 01:38:16,458
ZHANG XU
Don't mourn spring's fallen petals

1469
01:38:16,458 --> 01:38:18,542
spring's fallen petals

1470
01:38:19,750 --> 01:38:21,625
Great line!

1471
01:38:21,833 --> 01:38:23,958
Not an easy one to follow!

1472
01:38:23,958 --> 01:38:26,250
C'mon, if you don't do well

1473
01:38:26,250 --> 01:38:28,083
you have to stay on the plank!

1474
01:38:29,833 --> 01:38:34,167
Tomorrow we enter a glorious garden!

1475
01:38:34,167 --> 01:38:34,958
How's that?

1476
01:38:34,958 --> 01:38:37,625
It'll do. You can get down.

1477
01:38:37,625 --> 01:38:39,917
You need to do some calligraphy.

1478
01:38:39,917 --> 01:38:41,667
No problem.

1479
01:38:42,750 --> 01:38:44,042
Du Fu!

1480
01:38:45,250 --> 01:38:47,750
- A new friend?
- It's Cui Zongzhi's turn.

1481
01:38:47,792 --> 01:38:49,125
Can't I pass?

1482
01:38:50,250 --> 01:38:51,417
- Zongzhi, up you go.
- No!

1483
01:38:51,583 --> 01:38:52,125
I'm afraid of heights!

1484
01:38:52,125 --> 01:38:52,583
CUI ZONGZHI
I'm afraid of heights!

1485
01:38:52,583 --> 01:38:54,083
CUI ZONGZHI
You're younger than Inspector He

1486
01:38:54,083 --> 01:38:54,875
CUI ZONGZHI
you need a longer plank!

1487
01:38:54,875 --> 01:38:56,917
you need a longer plank!

1488
01:38:58,083 --> 01:38:59,708
Don't be afraid.

1489
01:38:59,708 --> 01:39:01,708
Here's a lute.

1490
01:39:01,708 --> 01:39:05,167
- Play and you'll be fine!
- Two lines!

1491
01:39:09,250 --> 01:39:10,750
Li Bai.

1492
01:39:13,708 --> 01:39:16,667
You missed! You're fined two cups!

1493
01:39:20,542 --> 01:39:23,250
Gao Shi, Gao Thirty-Five!

1494
01:39:24,875 --> 01:39:27,292
Come, come. This is

1495
01:39:27,292 --> 01:39:28,417
Gao Shi-

1496
01:39:28,417 --> 01:39:30,083
you've all heard of him, right?

1497
01:39:31,375 --> 01:39:33,792
We've been good friends for over 20 years.

1498
01:39:34,250 --> 01:39:36,333
Come, let me introduce you.

1499
01:39:37,083 --> 01:39:38,958
Prince of Ruyang!

1500
01:39:39,375 --> 01:39:41,667
Emperor Ruizong's eldest grandson!

1501
01:39:41,667 --> 01:39:44,250
We're all equals here, even the imperial clan!

1502
01:39:44,250 --> 01:39:45,125
It's an honor.

1503
01:39:45,417 --> 01:39:46,500
And this here

1504
01:39:47,125 --> 01:39:49,417
is Li Yong, Prefect Li-

1505
01:39:49,417 --> 01:39:51,458
best "running script" calligrapher of our day.

1506
01:39:51,458 --> 01:39:53,500
- A pleasure!
- I'm honored.

1507
01:39:55,250 --> 01:39:56,333
And these two gentlemen

1508
01:39:56,542 --> 01:39:58,750
are Wang Changling and Cen Shen!

1509
01:39:58,750 --> 01:40:00,167
You've heard of them, of course.

1510
01:40:00,417 --> 01:40:03,625
The bright moon of Qin, the passes of Han

1511
01:40:03,625 --> 01:40:05,708
The soldiers on the march have yet to return.

1512
01:40:05,708 --> 01:40:07,292
Just a minor poem.

1513
01:40:07,292 --> 01:40:10,708
As if brought by a spring breeze

1514
01:40:11,083 --> 01:40:14,583
Snow blooms on trees like pear blossoms

1515
01:40:16,208 --> 01:40:17,042
An honor.

1516
01:40:17,333 --> 01:40:19,625
You're all known for your border poems.

1517
01:40:20,000 --> 01:40:21,208
Honoured to meet you.

1518
01:40:21,292 --> 01:40:23,833
Cui Zongzhi young and gifted!

1519
01:40:26,917 --> 01:40:27,792
I'm honored.

1520
01:40:27,917 --> 01:40:29,333
Zongzhi's lute playing

1521
01:40:29,333 --> 01:40:33,167
expresses the anxiety of the battle march.

1522
01:40:33,167 --> 01:40:34,958
Brother Wang Wei!

1523
01:40:34,958 --> 01:40:36,083
Brother Wang Wei is here too.

1524
01:40:36,083 --> 01:40:37,583
Such serendipity!

1525
01:40:39,125 --> 01:40:39,958
Brother Wang Wei

1526
01:40:39,958 --> 01:40:41,917
join our poetry game?

1527
01:40:42,542 --> 01:40:46,000
Enjoy yourselves, I have to be somewhere.

1528
01:40:49,500 --> 01:40:52,167
That burp cost Wang Wei

1529
01:40:52,167 --> 01:40:54,125
ten years of self-cultivation.

1530
01:40:54,125 --> 01:40:55,292
My turn!

1531
01:40:55,292 --> 01:40:56,792
I'll have a go.

1532
01:40:58,917 --> 01:41:02,708
Gao Thirty-five, Gao Thirty-five

1533
01:41:03,083 --> 01:41:04,083
quickly, tell me-

1534
01:41:04,417 --> 01:41:07,542
what brings you here to Chang'an?

1535
01:41:08,375 --> 01:41:10,875
Why didn't you drop me a line first?

1536
01:41:10,875 --> 01:41:11,625
I...

1537
01:41:11,625 --> 01:41:13,958
I received your urgent letter.

1538
01:41:16,000 --> 01:41:17,833
My urgent letter?

1539
01:41:19,583 --> 01:41:22,000
Brother Changling, are you having trouble?

1540
01:41:22,000 --> 01:41:22,958
Brother Changling

1541
01:41:22,958 --> 01:41:24,292
if you can't continue the poem

1542
01:41:24,292 --> 01:41:25,375
you'll have to pay the penalty.

1543
01:41:25,375 --> 01:41:27,792
Here I come!

1544
01:41:31,625 --> 01:41:33,042
Give me the lute.

1545
01:41:37,292 --> 01:41:41,750
Li Bai is no ordinary mortal.

1546
01:41:41,750 --> 01:41:45,500
He's a celestial being!

1547
01:41:45,583 --> 01:41:49,125
So when can I get back to the heavens?

1548
01:41:49,458 --> 01:41:53,500
Exotic Beauty dance faster!

1549
01:41:53,500 --> 01:41:54,750
Here we go!

1550
01:42:01,292 --> 01:42:05,958
A zither from Dragon Gate's parasol tree

1551
01:42:06,750 --> 01:42:12,958
A jade cup with wine of perfect clarity

1552
01:42:12,958 --> 01:42:13,542
Bravo!

1553
01:42:13,542 --> 01:42:15,583
- Bravo!
- Li Bai a merchant's son

1554
01:42:15,583 --> 01:42:17,250
with exotic bloodlines.

1555
01:42:17,333 --> 01:42:19,333
And yet so famous.

1556
01:42:19,333 --> 01:42:21,958
The Tang really embraces all kinds.

1557
01:42:25,000 --> 01:42:30,792
I tune the strings and drink with thee

1558
01:42:33,250 --> 01:42:36,083
Lovely as flowers, Exotic Beauty

1559
01:42:36,083 --> 01:42:39,625
Selling wine, smiling at spring breezes

1560
01:42:39,625 --> 01:42:44,542
Smiling at spring breezes, dancing robes aflutter

1561
01:42:47,542 --> 01:42:49,292
You didn't follow the last verse

1562
01:42:49,292 --> 01:42:50,958
you wrote a new poem.

1563
01:42:50,958 --> 01:42:52,875
It's not even the same form.

1564
01:42:52,875 --> 01:42:54,250
Penalty!

1565
01:42:54,542 --> 01:42:57,458
Sure, what's the penalty?

1566
01:42:57,458 --> 01:43:00,708
Write ten poems or you can't come down.

1567
01:43:00,708 --> 01:43:02,667
Ten poems is nothing.

1568
01:43:02,667 --> 01:43:04,917
I'll write one hundred for you!

1569
01:43:04,917 --> 01:43:10,375
Beauty dance faster still!

1570
01:43:22,208 --> 01:43:23,292
Brother Gao!

1571
01:43:23,875 --> 01:43:24,833
Brother Gao!

1572
01:43:30,583 --> 01:43:31,500
Brother Gao!

1573
01:43:31,958 --> 01:43:33,000
Brother Gao!

1574
01:43:35,667 --> 01:43:38,917
Even my horse is keen to go home.

1575
01:43:40,083 --> 01:43:40,958
Brother Du

1576
01:43:41,292 --> 01:43:42,333
I take my leave.

1577
01:43:42,708 --> 01:43:43,833
No need to see me off.

1578
01:43:44,333 --> 01:43:45,542
You only just got to Chang'an

1579
01:43:45,542 --> 01:43:46,833
and now you're rushing off?

1580
01:43:46,833 --> 01:43:48,375
Why not stay a few more days?

1581
01:43:49,125 --> 01:43:50,333
Li Bai

1582
01:43:51,333 --> 01:43:52,625
when Brother Li Bai sobers up

1583
01:43:52,750 --> 01:43:54,792
he'll definitely want to keep you here.

1584
01:43:55,458 --> 01:43:56,833
This endless drinking

1585
01:43:57,542 --> 01:43:59,208
when will he ever sober up?

1586
01:44:02,083 --> 01:44:04,292
The Great Eagle soars amongst the clouds.

1587
01:44:04,417 --> 01:44:07,000
He has no time for mundanities.

1588
01:44:07,250 --> 01:44:08,708
I don't blame him.

1589
01:44:12,167 --> 01:44:12,917
Brother Du

1590
01:44:13,125 --> 01:44:14,333
before I leave

1591
01:44:14,375 --> 01:44:16,167
would you go somewhere with me?

1592
01:44:21,417 --> 01:44:26,583
QIAN TOMBS

1593
01:44:34,708 --> 01:44:35,833
Brother Du

1594
01:44:36,333 --> 01:44:37,667
did you know

1595
01:44:38,417 --> 01:44:39,708
that when my grandfather

1596
01:44:39,958 --> 01:44:42,250
was 20, as a cavalry officer

1597
01:44:42,333 --> 01:44:44,875
he captured the Turks' Chebi Khan.

1598
01:44:45,208 --> 01:44:48,042
At 30, he helped Li Ji
annihilate the Goguryeo Kingdom.

1599
01:44:48,167 --> 01:44:50,333
At 40, he smashed the Silla.

1600
01:44:51,083 --> 01:44:52,417
At 42

1601
01:44:54,792 --> 01:44:56,708
he passed away.

1602
01:45:01,208 --> 01:45:04,000
I'm 43 this year.

1603
01:45:08,958 --> 01:45:09,750
Brother Du

1604
01:45:10,042 --> 01:45:12,042
I hope you pass the exam and are admitted to court.

1605
01:45:12,042 --> 01:45:13,625
Here's to your early success.

1606
01:45:13,958 --> 01:45:14,625
Farewell!

1607
01:45:14,625 --> 01:45:15,625
Take care.

1608
01:45:23,125 --> 01:45:24,250
As for me

1609
01:45:24,708 --> 01:45:27,375
I returned home once more.

1610
01:45:32,333 --> 01:45:38,375
LIANG GARDENS ONE YEAR LATER

1611
01:45:44,792 --> 01:45:46,292
Good shot.

1612
01:45:57,667 --> 01:45:58,667
Why didn't you shoot?

1613
01:45:59,333 --> 01:46:00,500
A solitary goose

1614
01:46:01,542 --> 01:46:02,958
flying back south

1615
01:46:03,208 --> 01:46:05,125
let it go.

1616
01:46:05,500 --> 01:46:07,500
Brother Gao, such compassion

1617
01:46:07,500 --> 01:46:09,917
are you planning to become a Buddhist?

1618
01:46:11,667 --> 01:46:12,750
Brother Du Fu!

1619
01:46:16,500 --> 01:46:17,708
Brother Gao!

1620
01:46:19,625 --> 01:46:20,958
Have you been well?

1621
01:46:25,000 --> 01:46:26,417
Gao Thirty-five.

1622
01:46:27,625 --> 01:46:28,542
Li Bai

1623
01:46:29,667 --> 01:46:30,667
you...

1624
01:46:30,708 --> 01:46:32,958
why are you wearing Taoist robes?

1625
01:46:38,625 --> 01:46:40,500
These last few years in Chang'an

1626
01:46:40,750 --> 01:46:42,375
Li Linfu became increasingly

1627
01:46:42,542 --> 01:46:43,917
jealous and ill-willed towards Li Bai.

1628
01:46:46,083 --> 01:46:48,292
The emperor's Precious Consort hates me.

1629
01:46:49,125 --> 01:46:50,542
I thought I'd written a poem

1630
01:46:50,542 --> 01:46:53,000
in praise of her beauty.

1631
01:46:53,000 --> 01:46:53,917
I never imagined

1632
01:46:53,917 --> 01:46:57,125
she'd think I was mocking her.

1633
01:46:57,750 --> 01:46:59,917
so her cousin,
Chancellor Yang Guozhong, hates him too.

1634
01:47:00,125 --> 01:47:00,958
Chang'an

1635
01:47:01,417 --> 01:47:03,208
has become a treacherous place.

1636
01:47:04,542 --> 01:47:05,417
His Majesty...

1637
01:47:06,292 --> 01:47:08,208
I didn't win the Emperor's favor

1638
01:47:10,125 --> 01:47:12,292
and fell rudely from grace.

1639
01:47:16,542 --> 01:47:19,042
To bow and scrape before the high-born

1640
01:47:19,542 --> 01:47:22,625
Steals all the joy from my heart.

1641
01:47:24,667 --> 01:47:28,792
So... what do you plan to do?

1642
01:47:32,125 --> 01:47:34,208
I will enter a Taoist order.

1643
01:47:34,750 --> 01:47:36,292
A Taoist order?

1644
01:47:39,500 --> 01:47:40,750
Gao Shi-

1645
01:47:40,958 --> 01:47:42,500
I'm not joking.

1646
01:47:43,042 --> 01:47:44,125
Really.

1647
01:47:45,250 --> 01:47:46,833
Behold these ruins

1648
01:47:47,542 --> 01:47:49,042
once King Liang's garden palace.

1649
01:47:49,042 --> 01:47:50,625
Where is he now?

1650
01:47:50,875 --> 01:47:52,375
This terrace

1651
01:47:52,875 --> 01:47:55,958
once rang with song and dance.

1652
01:47:58,875 --> 01:48:01,042
When we met in our youth

1653
01:48:01,042 --> 01:48:02,917
we both had such ambition.

1654
01:48:03,750 --> 01:48:05,583
But in the blink of an eye

1655
01:48:10,625 --> 01:48:13,208
here we are, nearly fifty.

1656
01:48:14,167 --> 01:48:15,292
My wife

1657
01:48:16,042 --> 01:48:17,917
passed away recently.

1658
01:48:23,458 --> 01:48:25,250
The ways of this world

1659
01:48:25,583 --> 01:48:27,333
are no longer for me.

1660
01:48:33,292 --> 01:48:34,333
Gao Shi-

1661
01:48:35,375 --> 01:48:37,083
Life is short.

1662
01:48:40,167 --> 01:48:42,042
I want to become a Taoist hermit.

1663
01:48:56,667 --> 01:48:57,875
Master Gao of Beihai

1664
01:48:57,875 --> 01:48:59,750
has prepared a Taoist altar in Jinan

1665
01:49:00,208 --> 01:49:01,958
He'll officially ordain Brother Li there.

1666
01:49:02,375 --> 01:49:04,375
Brother Gao, you may not know

1667
01:49:04,750 --> 01:49:07,125
but ordination is an arduous undertaking.

1668
01:49:07,333 --> 01:49:09,042
Brother Li must ascend that altar

1669
01:49:09,042 --> 01:49:10,083
and chant scripture and spells

1670
01:49:10,250 --> 01:49:11,625
day and night.

1671
01:49:12,917 --> 01:49:14,875
So I want to ask the two of you

1672
01:49:15,208 --> 01:49:16,583
to support me.

1673
01:49:18,125 --> 01:49:18,917
Gao Shi-

1674
01:49:19,375 --> 01:49:20,958
you're my best friend.

1675
01:49:21,083 --> 01:49:21,958
You understand me.

1676
01:49:22,208 --> 01:49:23,000
With my character

1677
01:49:23,000 --> 01:49:23,958
if I go alone

1678
01:49:23,958 --> 01:49:25,708
I'll never make it.

1679
01:49:29,250 --> 01:49:30,708
This Great Eagle

1680
01:49:31,292 --> 01:49:32,917
can no longer fly

1681
01:49:33,542 --> 01:49:35,208
and doesn't want to either.

1682
01:49:37,583 --> 01:49:38,667
He said

1683
01:49:39,208 --> 01:49:41,167
I was his best friend.

1684
01:49:41,625 --> 01:49:43,000
Was I?

1685
01:49:44,333 --> 01:49:45,667
In any case

1686
01:49:46,542 --> 01:49:48,083
I agreed.

1687
01:49:49,167 --> 01:49:52,458
TAOIST ALTAR IN JINAN

1688
01:50:34,875 --> 01:50:36,625
Newly ordained Taoists,

1689
01:50:36,625 --> 01:50:37,167
Brother Li-

1690
01:50:37,167 --> 01:50:39,750
- Brother Li -
- the rituals have concluded.

1691
01:50:41,125 --> 01:50:43,000
Nothingness will be your teacher

1692
01:50:43,375 --> 01:50:45,250
and nature your friend.

1693
01:50:45,833 --> 01:50:48,000
Refine your snowy countenance

1694
01:50:48,542 --> 01:50:51,333
and extend your golden life.

1695
01:50:57,750 --> 01:50:58,708
Brother Gao

1696
01:51:00,042 --> 01:51:04,792
I saw the immortals of heaven

1697
01:51:05,417 --> 01:51:08,667
inviting me to return there

1698
01:51:10,458 --> 01:51:15,958
I want to return to heaven

1699
01:51:24,667 --> 01:51:27,292
Let's congratulate Brother Li Bai

1700
01:51:27,708 --> 01:51:30,375
CEN XUN MASTER DANQIU
on his admission to the Taoist orders.

1701
01:51:30,417 --> 01:51:31,333
LI YONG

1702
01:51:31,958 --> 01:51:33,250
Brother Li

1703
01:51:33,333 --> 01:51:35,417
you're a Taoist now.

1704
01:51:35,417 --> 01:51:37,167
You're a holy man.

1705
01:51:37,417 --> 01:51:40,875
Are you still going to drink like this?

1706
01:51:41,458 --> 01:51:42,833
Yes!

1707
01:51:43,292 --> 01:51:45,750
Wine is part of my spiritual practice.

1708
01:51:45,750 --> 01:51:48,083
It's the nectar of immortality.

1709
01:51:55,250 --> 01:51:56,375
Gao Shi-

1710
01:51:57,125 --> 01:51:59,333
in the 20 years of our acquaintance

1711
01:51:59,667 --> 01:52:01,542
this is the first time I've seen you

1712
01:52:01,542 --> 01:52:03,208
drink with such gusto!

1713
01:52:03,375 --> 01:52:04,500
Come! Come!

1714
01:52:04,667 --> 01:52:06,458
Drink up!

1715
01:52:08,083 --> 01:52:09,208
Bottoms up!

1716
01:52:10,750 --> 01:52:12,417
I can't drink anymore.

1717
01:52:12,417 --> 01:52:14,125
That won't do.

1718
01:52:14,125 --> 01:52:15,750
I'm done too.

1719
01:52:16,250 --> 01:52:17,250
No way.

1720
01:52:17,583 --> 01:52:18,542
Master Cen

1721
01:52:18,833 --> 01:52:20,083
Master Danqiu

1722
01:52:20,792 --> 01:52:22,333
You have to keep drinking!

1723
01:52:22,333 --> 01:52:24,083
Everyone has to drink.

1724
01:52:24,083 --> 01:52:25,500
No one stop!

1725
01:52:30,875 --> 01:52:32,708
I have a poem!

1726
01:52:33,000 --> 01:52:36,917
I'll revive your spirits with poetry.

1727
01:52:49,375 --> 01:52:50,958
Can you see

1728
01:52:52,292 --> 01:52:56,917
the Yellow River decanting from the sky

1729
01:52:59,417 --> 01:53:04,958
And racing to the sea never to return?

1730
01:53:08,292 --> 01:53:14,375
Can you see the grief of white hair in the mirrors

1731
01:53:14,375 --> 01:53:20,375
As dawn's black silk turns to evening snow?

1732
01:53:21,458 --> 01:53:24,375
When life goes well, be joyous

1733
01:53:24,375 --> 01:53:27,542
Never show the moon an empty cup

1734
01:53:29,542 --> 01:53:32,875
Heaven gave me talent for a reason

1735
01:53:34,125 --> 01:53:37,458
Spend now, riches return in season

1736
01:53:44,083 --> 01:53:47,958
Stew the lamb, prepare the ox, let us feast

1737
01:53:52,042 --> 01:53:56,042
Tonight we'll drink three hundred cups at least

1738
01:54:32,083 --> 01:54:34,542
Master Cen, Master Danqiu

1739
01:54:34,750 --> 01:54:37,792
drink and don't put down your cups

1740
01:54:43,292 --> 01:54:45,583
I'll sing for you

1741
01:54:45,583 --> 01:54:50,792
Please lend your ears

1742
01:55:04,917 --> 01:55:07,792
Bells and jades are not so precious

1743
01:55:08,458 --> 01:55:12,250
As eternal inebriation

1744
01:55:14,292 --> 01:55:17,375
Ancient sages leave no name

1745
01:55:17,583 --> 01:55:21,208
It's great drinkers who enjoy great fame

1746
01:55:25,208 --> 01:55:27,708
At the table of Prince Chen of old

1747
01:55:27,875 --> 01:55:31,375
Wine flowed like water

1748
01:55:38,917 --> 01:55:41,292
Hosts shouldn't fret over costs

1749
01:55:41,458 --> 01:55:44,292
Buy more wine and fill those cups

1750
01:55:44,333 --> 01:55:48,208
Fine horses, expensive robes

1751
01:55:48,208 --> 01:55:50,208
Tell the servant to sell these for wine

1752
01:55:50,208 --> 01:55:53,292
We'll banish sorrow from this world

1753
01:55:56,208 --> 01:55:59,208
We'll banish

1754
01:56:03,292 --> 01:56:09,208
sorrow from this world.

1755
01:56:41,500 --> 01:56:42,750
Li Bai-

1756
01:56:43,500 --> 01:56:44,792
I have to go.

1757
01:56:49,500 --> 01:56:50,708
You're going?

1758
01:56:51,458 --> 01:56:52,667
Yes.

1759
01:56:54,333 --> 01:56:56,042
After this goodbye

1760
01:56:56,375 --> 01:56:58,917
who knows when we'll meet again?

1761
01:57:00,208 --> 01:57:05,167
Perhaps we won't see each other again.

1762
01:57:06,708 --> 01:57:09,458
If we don't

1763
01:57:09,750 --> 01:57:11,542
see you in the celestial realms.

1764
01:57:14,292 --> 01:57:18,042
You're a celestial being, returning home.

1765
01:57:18,667 --> 01:57:19,875
As for me

1766
01:57:20,625 --> 01:57:23,125
I'm of this world.

1767
01:57:23,125 --> 01:57:26,292
I'll linger here.

1768
01:57:29,375 --> 01:57:31,042
Li Bai-

1769
01:57:31,792 --> 01:57:36,917
I'm off to the frontier to serve under Geshu Han.

1770
01:57:39,000 --> 01:57:42,708
I'll keep my ten year vow.

1771
01:57:43,042 --> 01:57:45,667
What... what vow?

1772
01:57:47,875 --> 01:57:51,292
Your poem said it all.

1773
01:57:52,458 --> 01:57:57,375
The Yellow River racing to the sea,
never to return.

1774
01:57:58,750 --> 01:58:00,500
Though I'm running out of time

1775
01:58:00,958 --> 01:58:05,250
when I face my ancestors

1776
01:58:05,583 --> 01:58:07,125
I'll be able to tell them

1777
01:58:08,000 --> 01:58:10,667
although I couldn't be like them

1778
01:58:10,917 --> 01:58:14,708
blooded heroes on the battlefield

1779
01:58:16,708 --> 01:58:18,375
and I was only able to become

1780
01:58:18,375 --> 01:58:20,958
a very minor clerk

1781
01:58:22,667 --> 01:58:25,708
yet with each stroke of my brush

1782
01:58:25,708 --> 01:58:29,250
I too galloped across battlefields.

1783
01:58:29,583 --> 01:58:30,833
Galloped...

1784
01:58:31,208 --> 01:58:32,667
Such lofty spirit!

1785
01:58:32,667 --> 01:58:35,000
Bravo, bravo!

1786
01:58:35,833 --> 01:58:38,208
But, Gao Shi-

1787
01:58:38,667 --> 01:58:41,667
If you're going to the frontier at your age

1788
01:58:43,792 --> 01:58:46,042
let me test how strong you are!

1789
01:58:46,458 --> 01:58:47,417
Come

1790
01:58:47,708 --> 01:58:49,583
let's wrestle.

1791
01:58:50,750 --> 01:58:51,667
Sure!

1792
01:59:42,667 --> 01:59:43,958
Gao Shi-

1793
01:59:44,792 --> 01:59:47,500
you won.

1794
01:59:50,250 --> 01:59:52,042
Go then.

1795
01:59:52,583 --> 01:59:53,958
Go then.

1796
01:59:58,167 --> 01:59:59,333
Farewell.

1797
02:00:13,042 --> 02:00:15,875
Warriors of Zhao with tassels flying

1798
02:00:15,875 --> 02:00:18,917
Curved swords bright as shining snow

1799
02:00:19,958 --> 02:00:22,667
Silver saddles on white steeds

1800
02:00:22,667 --> 02:00:25,625
Galloping past like shooting stars

1801
02:00:29,125 --> 02:00:33,333
I wrote this poem 20 years ago

1802
02:00:33,333 --> 02:00:37,875
it was my impression of you, Gao Shi!

1803
02:00:52,083 --> 02:00:56,792
The living are but passers-by

1804
02:00:57,250 --> 02:01:00,458
The dead have gone back home

1805
02:01:02,292 --> 02:01:05,833
The world is an inn that welcomes and farewells

1806
02:01:06,750 --> 02:01:10,292
The world is an inn that welcomes and farewells

1807
02:01:16,375 --> 02:01:22,708
The ancient dust is soaked with tears.

1808
02:01:33,208 --> 02:01:39,625
LONGYOU MILITARY CAMP

1809
02:01:46,125 --> 02:01:50,917
LONGYOU REGION GOVERNOR, GESHU HAN

1810
02:01:52,708 --> 02:01:54,292
When I first got to Longyou

1811
02:01:54,833 --> 02:01:56,958
we laid siege to Stone Fort.

1812
02:02:00,583 --> 02:02:02,667
STONE FORT

1813
02:02:02,667 --> 02:02:04,792
STONE FORT
It's easy to defend, hard to attack.

1814
02:02:04,792 --> 02:02:05,333
STONE FORT

1815
02:02:05,500 --> 02:02:09,292
For six months, 30,000 Tang soldiers laid siege.

1816
02:02:09,750 --> 02:02:11,625
Casualties were heavy.

1817
02:02:14,625 --> 02:02:19,208
Starved of supplies, the Tubos finally surrendered.

1818
02:02:19,583 --> 02:02:21,000
That's when we learned

1819
02:02:21,292 --> 02:02:25,417
only 600 men had defended the fort.

1820
02:02:26,292 --> 02:02:28,458
A mere 600 defenders

1821
02:02:28,792 --> 02:02:32,958
kept us pacing outside its walls half a year.

1822
02:02:37,042 --> 02:02:38,875
Yunshan Fort

1823
02:02:39,333 --> 02:02:42,833
is another Stone Fort.

1824
02:02:43,750 --> 02:02:44,875
Reporting!

1825
02:02:55,875 --> 02:02:57,333
Dawn.

1826
02:02:59,250 --> 02:03:01,458
I'm not here about Stone Fort.

1827
02:03:01,750 --> 02:03:02,875
Return to the topic of Li Bai.

1828
02:03:05,958 --> 02:03:08,667
Although I was at the frontier

1829
02:03:09,250 --> 02:03:12,208
I often read his new poems.

1830
02:03:12,917 --> 02:03:17,167
He roamed the great mountains and rivers.

1831
02:03:18,083 --> 02:03:21,500
He had regrets, but his poetry

1832
02:03:21,500 --> 02:03:23,083
became even more brilliant.

1833
02:03:24,583 --> 02:03:25,917
Sir

1834
02:03:26,458 --> 02:03:28,917
Do you have many regrets in life?

1835
02:03:31,792 --> 02:03:33,667
Regrets?

1836
02:03:35,458 --> 02:03:37,083
Of course.

1837
02:03:37,417 --> 02:03:40,375
Even if I perform meritorious deeds

1838
02:03:40,625 --> 02:03:43,750
only in the biographies of eunuchs

1839
02:03:43,750 --> 02:03:45,875
will people ever see my name.

1840
02:03:48,958 --> 02:03:52,208
The situation in the country is worrying.

1841
02:03:52,625 --> 02:03:54,667
The court is in chaos.

1842
02:03:54,917 --> 02:03:56,125
Everyone feels in danger.

1843
02:03:57,375 --> 02:03:59,500
Among the poets I know

1844
02:03:59,667 --> 02:04:03,250
Wang Changling and Cui Zongzhi are in exile.

1845
02:04:04,083 --> 02:04:06,250
Governor of Beihai, Li Yong.

1846
02:04:06,250 --> 02:04:10,167
was 70 when they beat him to death.

1847
02:04:12,333 --> 02:04:15,542
Frontier life is hard, but uncomplicated.

1848
02:04:16,792 --> 02:04:19,542
Ten years flew by.

1849
02:04:20,833 --> 02:04:24,083
My life was nearing its end.

1850
02:04:24,917 --> 02:04:28,958
These ten years seemed uneventful.

1851
02:04:31,083 --> 02:04:32,833
In all this time

1852
02:04:33,042 --> 02:04:35,458
I only saw Li Bai once.

1853
02:04:36,375 --> 02:04:39,542
I was in Xuan City on official business.

1854
02:04:40,125 --> 02:04:41,500
It was at the ferry crossing.

1855
02:04:42,125 --> 02:04:43,458
Who's that?

1856
02:04:43,583 --> 02:04:45,292
Li Bai, the great poet

1857
02:04:45,292 --> 02:04:46,833
and Taoist too!

1858
02:04:48,583 --> 02:04:50,875
Magistrate Wang Lun is a big fan.

1859
02:04:51,917 --> 02:04:53,375
that's Li Bai's new wife.

1860
02:04:53,375 --> 02:04:55,250
The granddaughter of Chancellor Zong.

1861
02:04:55,458 --> 02:04:56,708
LADY ZONG, LI BAI'S WIFE

1862
02:04:56,708 --> 02:04:59,125
MAGISTRATE WANG LUN
Things have worked out for him.

1863
02:05:00,042 --> 02:05:02,542
He joined her family, not the other way round.

1864
02:05:05,750 --> 02:05:08,375
For such an eminent family, I'd do it too.

1865
02:05:08,500 --> 02:05:09,750
And so would you!

1866
02:05:09,750 --> 02:05:11,958
Li Bai, ah, Li Bai-

1867
02:05:13,667 --> 02:05:16,542
I thought the paths we were on

1868
02:05:16,542 --> 02:05:18,042
were fixed.

1869
02:05:23,542 --> 02:05:26,250
But sometimes, suddenly,

1870
02:05:26,500 --> 02:05:28,208
within the space of a day,

1871
02:05:28,375 --> 02:05:32,500
a few centuries worth of events occur.

1872
02:05:33,125 --> 02:05:34,417
An Lushan

1873
02:05:34,417 --> 02:05:37,500
had been plotting rebellion for over ten years.

1874
02:05:37,583 --> 02:05:38,958
Who'd have thought that

1875
02:05:38,958 --> 02:05:42,083
Li Linfu, that rotten old stick

1876
02:05:42,083 --> 02:05:46,500
would be the last pillar to fall, toppling the house

1877
02:05:46,917 --> 02:05:49,083
Although Li Linfu was avaricious

1878
02:05:49,083 --> 02:05:50,625
he was also brilliant and capable.

1879
02:05:50,875 --> 02:05:53,792
After 19 years of holding the dynasty together

1880
02:05:53,792 --> 02:05:55,792
he died suddenly.

1881
02:05:56,250 --> 02:05:58,167
Yang Guozhong took his place.

1882
02:05:59,458 --> 02:06:00,875
An Lushan

1883
02:06:01,542 --> 02:06:02,708
rebelled.

1884
02:06:05,375 --> 02:06:06,625
Reporting!

1885
02:06:10,000 --> 02:06:11,417
Reporting!

1886
02:06:12,042 --> 02:06:14,208
Reporting!

1887
02:06:17,292 --> 02:06:19,042
Pass on the order

1888
02:06:19,333 --> 02:06:21,292
to gather the troops.

1889
02:06:24,042 --> 02:06:25,833
Official Appointments： Secretary,
Ranks Eight and below

1890
02:06:28,958 --> 02:06:32,792
TONG PASS

1891
02:06:45,208 --> 02:06:47,583
Gao Xianzhi and Feng Changqing

1892
02:06:48,208 --> 02:06:49,333
were both executed.

1893
02:06:51,583 --> 02:06:55,458
The great dynasty has no generals left.

1894
02:06:56,208 --> 02:07:00,417
I'm the last, and I'm half-paralysed.

1895
02:07:02,750 --> 02:07:05,708
If I defy orders to fight this important battle

1896
02:07:05,792 --> 02:07:08,750
the court will naturally execute me too.

1897
02:07:10,500 --> 02:07:12,625
Who will succeed me?

1898
02:07:13,458 --> 02:07:17,083
I fear it'll be the Eunuch Inspector Bian Lingcheng.

1899
02:07:24,917 --> 02:07:27,500
If I were a little younger

1900
02:07:28,375 --> 02:07:30,000
it'd be much better.

1901
02:07:39,250 --> 02:07:41,917
Ursa Major sits high in the sky

1902
02:07:44,083 --> 02:07:47,208
Geshu is armed day and night

1903
02:07:49,542 --> 02:07:52,125
The Tubos lurk about the herds

1904
02:07:54,125 --> 02:07:57,833
But dare not cross Lintao

1905
02:08:00,708 --> 02:08:02,375
Ride out the pass.

1906
02:08:57,917 --> 02:08:58,958
Open the gates!

1907
02:09:21,917 --> 02:09:24,875
The whole army is in agreement.

1908
02:09:26,417 --> 02:09:27,875
The Tang's luck has run out.

1909
02:09:28,125 --> 02:09:30,542
The world belongs to An Lushan's Yan dynasty.

1910
02:09:30,917 --> 02:09:33,500
We're defecting to An Lushan.

1911
02:09:35,917 --> 02:09:37,042
Geshu Han.

1912
02:09:38,167 --> 02:09:39,292
Geshu Han.

1913
02:09:39,542 --> 02:09:41,458
We'll ask you one last time

1914
02:09:41,833 --> 02:09:43,333
will you surrender

1915
02:09:43,708 --> 02:09:45,500
or not?

1916
02:09:58,917 --> 02:10:00,750
Help me onto my horse.

1917
02:10:09,542 --> 02:10:13,583
Sadly, I spent a life practicing the spear

1918
02:10:13,583 --> 02:10:15,083
yet never used it on a battlefield

1919
02:10:15,958 --> 02:10:19,750
But I'll use it against these backstabbers.

1920
02:10:20,708 --> 02:10:22,000
Gao Shi-

1921
02:10:22,375 --> 02:10:26,125
It's me those traitors are after.

1922
02:10:27,208 --> 02:10:32,458
If you can, I want you to escape the siege

1923
02:10:32,458 --> 02:10:34,667
and tell the emperor

1924
02:10:35,208 --> 02:10:39,500
that not all northern tribes are traitors!

1925
02:11:06,292 --> 02:11:07,250
General!

1926
02:11:07,583 --> 02:11:09,875
Go, Gao Shi!

1927
02:11:10,875 --> 02:11:12,500
I, Geshu Han,

1928
02:11:12,500 --> 02:11:14,625
won't surrender!

1929
02:11:15,042 --> 02:11:17,292
Go!

1930
02:12:11,333 --> 02:12:16,750
CHANG'AN

1931
02:13:16,833 --> 02:13:19,000
Tong Pass had fallen.

1932
02:13:19,458 --> 02:13:21,958
The court had fled from Chang'an.

1933
02:13:23,375 --> 02:13:25,875
I chased westwards after them.

1934
02:13:26,958 --> 02:13:29,167
They killed the Chancellor

1935
02:13:29,167 --> 02:13:30,917
and made the Precious Consort commit suicide.

1936
02:13:31,708 --> 02:13:35,125
I heard many officials and soldiers

1937
02:13:35,250 --> 02:13:38,125
had surrendered to An Lushan.

1938
02:13:38,542 --> 02:13:40,458
Among those who hadn't

1939
02:13:40,917 --> 02:13:45,750
some powerful and ambitious men

1940
02:13:46,042 --> 02:13:47,417
had mutinied.

1941
02:13:51,500 --> 02:13:56,083
The world was in chaos.

1942
02:13:58,583 --> 02:14:00,500
Early summer,
the 44th year of Emperor Xuanzong's reign.

1943
02:14:00,500 --> 02:14:02,708
Emperor Xuanzong fled Chang'an for Sichuan.

1944
02:14:02,708 --> 02:14:05,250
Mid-summer, in Ningxia,
his son was crowned Emperor Suzong.

1945
02:14:05,250 --> 02:14:07,208
Xuanzong was named Emperor Emeritus.

1946
02:14:07,208 --> 02:14:08,792
Xuanzong appointed his sons

1947
02:14:08,792 --> 02:14:10,417
to the posts of regional governors.

1948
02:14:10,417 --> 02:14:13,458
He made Prince Yong Governor
of the Four Regions and General of Jiangling.

1949
02:14:13,458 --> 02:14:16,292
In autumn,
Suzong ordered Prince Yong back to Sichuan.

1950
02:14:16,292 --> 02:14:19,083
Prince Yong refused.

1951
02:14:21,250 --> 02:14:26,167
YANGZHOU.
SIX MONTHS AFTER THE FALL OF TONG PASS.

1952
02:14:26,167 --> 02:14:27,958
The new Southern Region Governor

1953
02:14:27,958 --> 02:14:30,750
has control of the Yangtze-Huai area

1954
02:14:30,750 --> 02:14:32,750
and quelled the prince's rebellion.

1955
02:14:44,250 --> 02:14:48,667
GAO SHI,
SOUTHERN REGION GOVERNOR

1956
02:14:48,667 --> 02:14:49,667
Reporting, sir.

1957
02:14:50,208 --> 02:14:52,583
Rebel troops are gathering at Jiangling.

1958
02:15:01,792 --> 02:15:02,917
Sir

1959
02:15:02,917 --> 02:15:05,792
Prince Yong orders state
revenues sent to Jiangling.

1960
02:15:05,792 --> 02:15:07,250
Cavalry scouts have left Jiangling.

1961
02:15:52,917 --> 02:15:54,000
Reporting, sir

1962
02:15:54,000 --> 02:15:56,875
Prince Yong's troops have left Jiangling,
whereabouts uncertain.

1963
02:15:57,042 --> 02:16:00,083
Prince Yong issued a call to all "heroes".

1964
02:16:00,208 --> 02:16:00,958
Read it.

1965
02:16:01,667 --> 02:16:03,167
It's said that extraordinary crises

1966
02:16:03,167 --> 02:16:04,875
give rise to extraordinary people

1967
02:16:04,875 --> 02:16:06,250
who achieve extraordinary things. Prince Yong-

1968
02:16:07,125 --> 02:16:10,375
It was an extraordinary crisis indeed

1969
02:16:11,042 --> 02:16:14,250
that led me, a lowly official of below 8th Rank

1970
02:16:14,417 --> 02:16:15,708
within six months

1971
02:16:15,708 --> 02:16:18,625
to become the Governor of three regions.

1972
02:16:22,833 --> 02:16:25,792
Governor, we have news of Prince Yong's army.

1973
02:16:26,500 --> 02:16:27,208
Tell me.

1974
02:16:27,292 --> 02:16:28,292
They're coming down the Yangtze

1975
02:16:28,292 --> 02:16:29,750
heading for our army in Yangzhou.

1976
02:16:30,000 --> 02:16:31,042
They'll arrive in three days.

1977
02:16:33,833 --> 02:16:37,625
Prince Yong is a mediocrity,
more ambitious than wise.

1978
02:16:38,667 --> 02:16:40,208
If he wanted to win control

1979
02:16:40,208 --> 02:16:42,708
he'd ride north to retake Chang'an from the rebels

1980
02:16:42,708 --> 02:16:46,333
or east to relieve the siege of Suiyang

1981
02:16:46,833 --> 02:16:49,417
It wouldn't be easy, but if successful,

1982
02:16:49,417 --> 02:16:51,333
it would change the world.

1983
02:16:51,833 --> 02:16:54,500
To ride southeast to attack me

1984
02:16:54,500 --> 02:16:56,792
is the cowardly act of a weak ruler.

1985
02:16:56,792 --> 02:17:00,583
How can he win the loyalty of heroes?

1986
02:17:01,625 --> 02:17:03,833
Does he have much clout?

1987
02:17:03,833 --> 02:17:07,000
Have any great men joined in his cause?

1988
02:17:07,042 --> 02:17:08,375
Prince Yong has sent out the call

1989
02:17:08,375 --> 02:17:09,750
but no one has answered.

1990
02:17:11,000 --> 02:17:12,958
Oh, right, except one poet.

1991
02:17:13,458 --> 02:17:14,333
Li Bai.

1992
02:17:14,958 --> 02:17:16,042
Li Bai?

1993
02:17:16,292 --> 02:17:18,292
Li Bai is on Prince Yong's side?

1994
02:17:22,500 --> 02:17:25,667
Li Bai wrote eleven whole poems for him.

1995
02:17:26,125 --> 02:17:27,750
Eleven poems?

1996
02:17:29,375 --> 02:17:31,958
In spring Prince Yong leads his army east

1997
02:17:32,333 --> 02:17:34,750
Flying the Imperial standard

1998
02:17:35,833 --> 02:17:38,625
His warships calm the winds and sea

1999
02:17:38,750 --> 02:17:41,167
Turning mighty rivers into gentle ponds

2000
02:17:41,417 --> 02:17:44,167
Mt Beigu was once a fortress of Wu

2001
02:17:44,333 --> 02:17:47,125
The towers' reflections shimmered on the water

2002
02:18:19,417 --> 02:18:20,375
Madam Li

2003
02:18:22,333 --> 02:18:24,292
Prince Yong has been executed.

2004
02:18:25,208 --> 02:18:27,042
Li Bai's crime

2005
02:18:27,042 --> 02:18:28,917
is that of treason.

2006
02:18:29,167 --> 02:18:31,917
LADY ZONG, LI BAI'S WIFE

2007
02:18:31,917 --> 02:18:32,708
LADY ZONG, LI BAI'S WIFE
I know.

2008
02:18:32,708 --> 02:18:33,375
LADY ZONG, LI BAI'S WIFE

2009
02:19:04,708 --> 02:19:05,917
Li Bai-

2010
02:19:10,833 --> 02:19:12,250
You'd already taken a Taoist path.

2011
02:19:12,750 --> 02:19:14,208
Why tangle with worldly affairs?

2012
02:19:21,375 --> 02:19:25,417
I failed to advance my spiritual state.

2013
02:19:26,333 --> 02:19:32,333
Between mountain and sea, where do immortals dwell?

2014
02:19:34,417 --> 02:19:37,375
My wife and I lived a solitary life on Mt Lu.

2015
02:19:37,375 --> 02:19:40,667
Prince Yong sent several emissaries

2016
02:19:40,667 --> 02:19:43,375
to invite me to help him.

2017
02:19:43,708 --> 02:19:47,625
I wanted such a chance my whole life.

2018
02:19:47,625 --> 02:19:50,083
Though I'm old, how could I refuse?

2019
02:19:50,083 --> 02:19:52,167
You didn't know he was rebelling?

2020
02:19:52,833 --> 02:19:54,083
Rebelling?

2021
02:19:54,417 --> 02:19:57,375
Wasn't he the Tang's top military officer?

2022
02:19:57,375 --> 02:19:59,083
Top military officer?

2023
02:19:59,500 --> 02:20:01,333
You didn't realise that in such chaos

2024
02:20:01,333 --> 02:20:03,500
all types of men would claim the throne?

2025
02:20:05,625 --> 02:20:06,583
But...

2026
02:20:09,833 --> 02:20:10,792
Li Bai

2027
02:20:11,542 --> 02:20:13,792
do you know where you are now?

2028
02:20:15,542 --> 02:20:16,875
Jiangxia.

2029
02:20:17,417 --> 02:20:19,000
Yellow Crane Tower.

2030
02:20:19,083 --> 02:20:20,417
Yellow Crane Tower?

2031
02:20:21,500 --> 02:20:24,167
Right. Gao Shi, Governor Gao

2032
02:20:24,167 --> 02:20:26,750
we got to know each other here.

2033
02:20:27,208 --> 02:20:30,250
Jiangxia... Yellow Crane Tower...

2034
02:20:30,542 --> 02:20:32,875
Gao Thirty-Five will save me.

2035
02:20:32,875 --> 02:20:33,625
You...

2036
02:20:33,625 --> 02:20:35,417
The depth of your old friendship

2037
02:20:35,417 --> 02:20:37,208
means they suspect a cover up!

2038
02:20:37,208 --> 02:20:38,792
Don't you see?

2039
02:20:41,000 --> 02:20:42,458
I won't say any more.

2040
02:20:42,458 --> 02:20:43,667
Just come and see this!

2041
02:20:59,083 --> 02:21:01,250
The governor said to tell you

2042
02:21:01,750 --> 02:21:03,458
to take a good look.

2043
02:21:04,167 --> 02:21:05,875
The world of the Tang

2044
02:21:05,875 --> 02:21:09,000
is in turmoil,
devastation as far as the eye can see.

2045
02:21:09,708 --> 02:21:11,500
Everywhere is like Jiangxia.

2046
02:21:12,333 --> 02:21:15,458
Everywhere is in ruins like Yellow Crane Tower.

2047
02:21:30,250 --> 02:21:31,458
Madam Li

2048
02:21:32,958 --> 02:21:35,000
Please don't worry about me.

2049
02:21:36,125 --> 02:21:37,833
I'm not like my husband

2050
02:21:38,375 --> 02:21:39,292
I..

2051
02:21:40,042 --> 02:21:41,750
am so disheartened.

2052
02:21:42,875 --> 02:21:47,292
I'll spend my remaining years
in seclusion on Mt Lu.

2053
02:21:49,625 --> 02:21:50,958
Take care.

2054
02:22:00,250 --> 02:22:01,542
Wife!

2055
02:22:03,292 --> 02:22:04,542
Wife!

2056
02:22:05,250 --> 02:22:06,167
Wife!

2057
02:22:06,542 --> 02:22:10,167
I'll return to Mt Lu!

2058
02:22:11,042 --> 02:22:15,125
Wait for me!

2059
02:22:39,083 --> 02:22:40,583
You didn't save Li Bai.

2060
02:22:42,292 --> 02:22:45,792
Court politics were like skating on thin ice.

2061
02:22:46,667 --> 02:22:50,833
You were always one step from the abyss.

2062
02:22:52,875 --> 02:22:55,500
Guo Ziyi interceded with the emperor

2063
02:22:55,708 --> 02:22:56,792
and saved him.

2064
02:22:58,250 --> 02:23:02,292
Instead of execution, exile in the southwest.

2065
02:23:03,500 --> 02:23:05,625
Today the Tang has two elite armies.

2066
02:23:06,000 --> 02:23:09,167
One is under Guo Ziyi.

2067
02:23:09,708 --> 02:23:10,875
The other

2068
02:23:11,083 --> 02:23:13,792
is under your command.

2069
02:23:14,292 --> 02:23:15,250
Yes.

2070
02:23:15,625 --> 02:23:17,958
The Tubos have besieged Chang'an for three months.

2071
02:23:18,125 --> 02:23:19,958
You haven't mobilised your troops.

2072
02:23:20,417 --> 02:23:23,375
Are you afraid of repeating Geshu Han's mistake

2073
02:23:23,542 --> 02:23:25,750
when his army was annihilated outside Tong Pass?

2074
02:23:27,583 --> 02:23:31,208
I'm also afraid of repeating Li Bai's mistake.

2075
02:23:32,000 --> 02:23:36,917
In old age, haste leads to error.

2076
02:23:38,167 --> 02:23:40,375
But the gossip in court has it

2077
02:23:40,375 --> 02:23:41,833
that you and Guo Ziyi

2078
02:23:41,833 --> 02:23:44,792
fell out over whether to save Li Bai.

2079
02:23:44,792 --> 02:23:47,917
That it's because of this discord

2080
02:23:47,917 --> 02:23:50,458
that you won't mobilise your army.

2081
02:23:50,958 --> 02:23:53,458
The emperor sent me here

2082
02:23:54,583 --> 02:23:57,000
to get to the bottom of all this!

2083
02:23:58,458 --> 02:24:03,125
The Tubos have also heard this rumour.

2084
02:24:04,083 --> 02:24:05,333
Reporting!

2085
02:24:05,833 --> 02:24:06,917
Reporting, Governor

2086
02:24:06,917 --> 02:24:08,417
Tubo troops are halfway through the valley.

2087
02:24:08,417 --> 02:24:10,292
They're three hours away from here.

2088
02:24:13,083 --> 02:24:16,958
Of the men at the Qujiang wineshop that day

2089
02:24:17,458 --> 02:24:23,875
He Zhizhang, Wang Changling, Cui Zongzhi are dead.

2090
02:24:24,333 --> 02:24:25,667
Though still alive

2091
02:24:26,042 --> 02:24:28,625
Du Fu wanders homeless

2092
02:24:28,875 --> 02:24:32,083
and Wang Wei, imprisoned by the traitors,

2093
02:24:32,083 --> 02:24:36,333
lingers on in desolation.

2094
02:24:39,292 --> 02:24:40,833
This candle

2095
02:24:41,083 --> 02:24:42,708
whatever happens,

2096
02:24:43,625 --> 02:24:45,958
will be extinguished.

2097
02:24:56,417 --> 02:24:58,417
The drops of blood on this bandage

2098
02:24:58,458 --> 02:25:01,458
are just red wine dregs.

2099
02:25:07,833 --> 02:25:09,958
Why are you toying with me?

2100
02:25:11,708 --> 02:25:13,625
I apologise, sir.

2101
02:25:14,167 --> 02:25:16,625
But it's time to take back Yunshan Fort.

2102
02:25:17,500 --> 02:25:19,208
Hand me my spear!

2103
02:25:47,708 --> 02:25:50,583
This is a long-forgotten old road.

2104
02:25:50,917 --> 02:25:53,625
The steep path can't accomodate a large army.

2105
02:25:53,625 --> 02:25:55,125
But it's a shortcut.

2106
02:25:55,500 --> 02:25:56,500
In two hours

2107
02:25:56,500 --> 02:25:59,042
we'll reach the walls of Yunshan.

2108
02:26:31,458 --> 02:26:37,375
FORT YUNSHAN OUTSKIRTS

2109
02:26:40,958 --> 02:26:42,208
I understand.

2110
02:26:43,625 --> 02:26:45,500
Today, here,

2111
02:26:45,667 --> 02:26:47,042
you face the same predicament

2112
02:26:47,042 --> 02:26:48,958
as Geshu Han did at Tong Pass.

2113
02:26:50,000 --> 02:26:52,333
Whether you stay or go, you lose.

2114
02:26:52,833 --> 02:26:54,750
So you're doing neither.

2115
02:26:54,958 --> 02:26:56,375
Instead, you're taking a step back

2116
02:26:56,458 --> 02:26:58,917
to lure the Tubos into the narrow gorge

2117
02:26:59,250 --> 02:27:02,208
recovering Yunshan while cutting off their retreat.

2118
02:27:02,833 --> 02:27:04,667
Now those 70,000 Tubo soldiers

2119
02:27:04,667 --> 02:27:06,042
have no escape route.

2120
02:27:06,042 --> 02:27:07,583
They're like a turtle in an urn.

2121
02:27:08,250 --> 02:27:10,833
The Tubos besieging Chang'an

2122
02:27:10,833 --> 02:27:12,083
will abandon the siege

2123
02:27:12,083 --> 02:27:14,542
to save this turtle.

2124
02:27:14,833 --> 02:27:15,833
Brilliant.

2125
02:27:17,417 --> 02:27:20,792
But Governor Gao, Lushui Pass may be risky.

2126
02:27:20,792 --> 02:27:22,458
It's only held by 6,000 soldiers.

2127
02:27:23,667 --> 02:27:25,167
What if they can't defend it?

2128
02:27:26,208 --> 02:27:27,583
The Tubo Army

2129
02:27:27,583 --> 02:27:29,542
The Tubo Army is coming!

2130
02:27:29,958 --> 02:27:31,417
You're right.

2131
02:27:31,958 --> 02:27:32,833
But Yan Wu

2132
02:27:32,833 --> 02:27:35,875
should be at Lushui Pass by now.

2133
02:27:36,125 --> 02:27:39,125
The man who came here was his messenger.

2134
02:27:39,208 --> 02:27:41,958
Yan Wu and his 20,000 elite troops

2135
02:27:41,958 --> 02:27:45,125
weren't really coming in two days

2136
02:27:45,333 --> 02:27:46,958
The reinforcements are here!

2137
02:27:46,958 --> 02:27:47,917
but

2138
02:27:47,917 --> 02:27:49,917
today at dawn.

2139
02:28:00,458 --> 02:28:01,750
My respect.

2140
02:28:02,042 --> 02:28:04,583
Your Excellency is famous for
being straightforward

2141
02:28:04,583 --> 02:28:07,708
and yet you pulled off this masterful ruse.

2142
02:28:08,292 --> 02:28:10,250
Chang'an will be saved.

2143
02:28:10,583 --> 02:28:14,625
As Inspector Gao's top disciple

2144
02:28:14,625 --> 02:28:17,458
you're of course a great martial artist too.

2145
02:28:17,458 --> 02:28:19,458
That year of the rebellion

2146
02:28:19,458 --> 02:28:23,000
Inspector Gao took on the enemy single-handed.

2147
02:28:23,000 --> 02:28:25,375
And you are his worthy successor!

2148
02:28:25,375 --> 02:28:26,583
Governor Gao-

2149
02:28:26,583 --> 02:28:29,042
wouldn't such a provocation be too obvious?

2150
02:29:23,458 --> 02:29:24,667
There's trouble!

2151
02:29:25,000 --> 02:29:27,042
Assemble! Hurry!

2152
02:30:10,250 --> 02:30:12,917
This is for Chang'an!

2153
02:30:13,958 --> 02:30:17,000
Chang'an!

2154
02:30:22,542 --> 02:30:25,000
Fall into formation!

2155
02:31:06,667 --> 02:31:09,958
Gao Shi-Do you know how to trick your opponent?

2156
02:31:10,750 --> 02:31:13,917
Create a detailed scenario so plausible

2157
02:31:13,917 --> 02:31:16,500
that no matter how you view it

2158
02:31:16,500 --> 02:31:18,250
it looks real.

2159
02:31:19,375 --> 02:31:23,583
So real you even fool yourself.

2160
02:31:57,333 --> 02:32:00,542
Yan Wu is young, vigorous and brave.

2161
02:32:01,292 --> 02:32:03,000
These 70,000 Tubos

2162
02:32:03,000 --> 02:32:05,792
are hungry, cold and will be easily beaten.

2163
02:32:09,417 --> 02:32:11,167
Governor Gao knows of course

2164
02:32:11,417 --> 02:32:12,625
that this plan

2165
02:32:12,625 --> 02:32:15,750
means Yan Wu will get all credit for the victory.

2166
02:32:19,542 --> 02:32:21,167
I take my leave.

2167
02:32:46,292 --> 02:32:48,958
Governor Gao, when I passed by Chengdu

2168
02:32:48,958 --> 02:32:50,208
I saw Du Fu.

2169
02:32:50,375 --> 02:32:53,083
Oh, how is he?

2170
02:32:53,250 --> 02:32:54,250
Very good.

2171
02:32:54,375 --> 02:32:55,250
He said

2172
02:32:55,375 --> 02:32:57,917
to thank Your Excellency
for looking after him there.

2173
02:33:13,125 --> 02:33:14,417
Du Fu also said

2174
02:33:14,500 --> 02:33:16,958
that when Guo Ziyi acted to save Li Bai

2175
02:33:16,958 --> 02:33:18,583
it was because Your Excellency had written

2176
02:33:18,583 --> 02:33:20,250
to plead with him.

2177
02:33:21,125 --> 02:33:22,708
You wanted to save Li Bai

2178
02:33:22,708 --> 02:33:24,292
but wanted Guo Ziyi to do it

2179
02:33:24,417 --> 02:33:27,000
to prevent talk that you did it out of friendship

2180
02:33:27,250 --> 02:33:28,625
which would hurt Li Bai.

2181
02:33:29,750 --> 02:33:32,458
Your Excellency, I guessed right, yes?

2182
02:33:36,750 --> 02:33:38,792
I also have news of Li Bai.

2183
02:33:38,917 --> 02:33:39,833
What?

2184
02:33:39,917 --> 02:33:42,792
Before the New Year,
the emperor announced an amnesty.

2185
02:33:43,417 --> 02:33:45,708
Li Bai has been pardoned!

2186
02:33:48,250 --> 02:33:50,458
He wrote a new poem after his pardon.

2187
02:33:50,958 --> 02:33:52,375
I've memorised it.

2188
02:34:02,125 --> 02:34:08,917
Out from Baidi amongst the coloured clouds

2189
02:34:09,958 --> 02:34:16,333
A thousand miles to Jiangling in a day

2190
02:34:17,417 --> 02:34:24,500
The monkeys chitter on the banks

2191
02:34:25,000 --> 02:34:32,667
My little boat passes by ten thousand peaks.

2192
02:34:35,083 --> 02:34:38,333
The monkeys chitter on the banks

2193
02:34:38,333 --> 02:34:45,875
My little boat passes by ten thousand peaks.

2194
02:35:08,333 --> 02:35:11,083
Your Excellency, you can tell from the poem

2195
02:35:11,083 --> 02:35:12,333
that he's in good spirits.

2196
02:35:13,042 --> 02:35:14,708
He hadn't reached his place of exile

2197
02:35:15,083 --> 02:35:18,875
when, in Baidi, he got news of his pardon.

2198
02:35:50,750 --> 02:35:53,417
Sir, we're ready to depart.

2199
02:35:54,333 --> 02:35:55,250
Okay.

2200
02:36:08,417 --> 02:36:09,792
In this collection,

2201
02:36:09,792 --> 02:36:11,083
whose poems do you like?

2202
02:36:11,875 --> 02:36:13,708
Of course, yours.

2203
02:36:13,708 --> 02:36:15,167
Cut the sweet talk.

2204
02:36:15,167 --> 02:36:16,292
Who else?

2205
02:36:17,292 --> 02:36:20,958
Cui Hao, Meng Haoran,
Wang Changling are all great!

2206
02:36:20,958 --> 02:36:22,583
Cen Shen too.

2207
02:36:22,792 --> 02:36:25,750
Wang Wei his poems

2208
02:36:25,833 --> 02:36:27,542
are too hard for me to understand.

2209
02:36:27,750 --> 02:36:29,583
You'll understand them one day.

2210
02:36:35,542 --> 02:36:36,375
Of course.

2211
02:36:36,375 --> 02:36:38,250
Sir, don't think badly of me

2212
02:36:38,250 --> 02:36:40,125
but I like Li Bai's poems best.

2213
02:36:40,667 --> 02:36:45,125
Chang'an in a flood of moonlight;
ten thousand homely sounds

2214
02:36:45,417 --> 02:36:46,500
So great.

2215
02:36:49,042 --> 02:36:50,250
By the way, sir

2216
02:36:50,417 --> 02:36:51,500
why weren't Du Fu's poems

2217
02:36:51,500 --> 02:36:53,708
included in this collection?

2218
02:36:53,708 --> 02:36:55,667
Aren't they good enough?

2219
02:36:55,667 --> 02:36:59,125
They'll appear in other anthologies.

2220
02:36:59,125 --> 02:37:00,917
No taste!

2221
02:37:01,708 --> 02:37:04,292
But all the Yellow Crane Tower poems

2222
02:37:04,417 --> 02:37:05,958
are in the collection.

2223
02:37:06,583 --> 02:37:08,542
Such a pity

2224
02:37:08,542 --> 02:37:11,167
the tower was burnt and is no more.

2225
02:37:13,958 --> 02:37:15,250
It's okay.

2226
02:37:16,375 --> 02:37:19,333
So long as the Yellow Crane Tower poems exist

2227
02:37:20,042 --> 02:37:22,625
Yellow Crane Tower is still with us.

2228
02:37:26,167 --> 02:37:28,958
Of the three hundred thousand;
only I returned to Chang'an.

2229
02:37:28,958 --> 02:37:29,917
Who's is that?

2230
02:37:30,083 --> 02:37:31,458
Wang Changling.

2231
02:37:31,792 --> 02:37:33,833
A young soldier of Chang'an

2232
02:37:33,833 --> 02:37:36,417
mounts the ramparts to regard the Warrior Star

2233
02:37:36,417 --> 02:37:37,625
Wang Wei!

2234
02:37:38,250 --> 02:37:42,292
At twenty, master of book and sword;
I go to Chang'an

2235
02:37:42,458 --> 02:37:45,167
Little devil, I wrote that!

2236
02:37:47,000 --> 02:37:51,125
Gazing from afar toward Chang'an;
how I miss its people.

2237
02:37:52,833 --> 02:37:56,042
Li Bai! Li Taibai!

2238
02:37:56,667 --> 02:38:00,958
Chang'an is like a dream; when might I return?

2239
02:38:01,208 --> 02:38:03,583
That's Li Bai too!

2240
02:38:06,958 --> 02:38:08,458
Chang'an

2241
02:38:09,458 --> 02:38:11,042
so long as poetry exists

2242
02:38:11,625 --> 02:38:12,917
and books exist,

2243
02:38:13,792 --> 02:38:17,667
Chang'an will still be with us.

2244
02:39:09,500 --> 02:39:10,833
Li Bai, at your service.

2245
02:39:11,333 --> 02:39:13,625
Gao Shi, at yours.

2246
02:39:35,625 --> 02:39:38,667
In winter, Li Bai passed away.

2247
02:39:38,667 --> 02:39:41,750
In the second year of Emperor Daizong's reign,

2248
02:39:41,750 --> 02:39:45,333
Yan Wu defeated the
70,000 Tubo soldiers trapped in the gorge.

2249
02:39:45,333 --> 02:39:47,625
Guo Ziyi recovered Chang'an.

2250
02:39:47,625 --> 02:39:50,333
Gao Shi returned to Chang'an
and was demoted.

2251
02:39:50,333 --> 02:39:54,458
But he was soon promoted to
Imperial Advisor and made Marquis of Bohai.

2252
02:39:54,458 --> 02:39:58,000
Of all the Tang poets,
he had the most distinguished record of service.

2253
02:39:58,000 --> 02:39:59,708
Two years later, Gao Shi died.

2254
02:40:03,667 --> 02:40:11,375
Chang An

2255
02:40:30,208 --> 02:40:34,833
Gazing from Chang'an at brocaded peaks

2256
02:40:35,292 --> 02:40:41,125
Doors fling open at the
mountaintop retreat. (Du Mu)

2257
02:40:41,833 --> 02:40:45,583
Life is short, drink till you're old

2258
02:40:45,583 --> 02:40:49,125
and snow blankets the streets
of Chang'an. (Shu Dan)

2259
02:40:49,750 --> 02:40:56,500
Before Calyx Hall the dew is fresh

2260
02:40:56,500 --> 02:41:04,375
The people of Chang'an are at peace. (Zhang Yue)

2261
02:41:04,542 --> 02:41:08,542
Time loosens beauty's hold

2262
02:41:08,542 --> 02:41:12,375
Have you not seen our visitor

2263
02:41:12,500 --> 02:41:18,667
Each time he's here, he grows old. (Bai Juyi)

2264
02:41:20,333 --> 02:41:24,333
Chang'an in a flood of moonlight

2265
02:41:24,333 --> 02:41:28,542
Ten thousand homely sounds (Li Bai)

2266
02:41:30,083 --> 02:41:37,208
A young soldier of Chang'an

2267
02:41:37,208 --> 02:41:44,417
mounts the ramparts to
regard the Warrior Star (Wang Wei)

2268
02:41:45,417 --> 02:41:48,667
I was banished to far-off Changsha

2269
02:41:48,667 --> 02:41:52,167
My gaze strains westward towards Chang'an and home

2270
02:41:52,167 --> 02:41:55,625
I play my melancholy flute
in the Yellow Crane tower

2271
02:41:55,750 --> 02:41:59,958
In spring plum blossoms rain down
on River Town (Li Bai)

2272
02:44:29,708 --> 02:44:34,583
As the sun and I set down the mountain

2273
02:44:34,583 --> 02:44:39,250
Am I followed by the moon?

2274
02:44:39,250 --> 02:44:44,750
Searching for the paths that led here

2275
02:44:44,750 --> 02:44:47,833
Green mountain forests so quiet and deep

2276
02:44:47,833 --> 02:44:50,500
Long blue mountain mists

2277
02:44:55,083 --> 02:44:59,917
Hard is the journey under the blue skies of Shu

2278
02:44:59,917 --> 02:45:04,458
In endless mountains I lose my way

2279
02:45:04,458 --> 02:45:10,167
Though laugh you may,
I'm still drunk when from dreams I wake

2280
02:45:10,167 --> 02:45:16,917
My solitary boat has sailed a thousand streams

2281
02:45:17,708 --> 02:45:22,667
With talent I have been endowed

2282
02:45:22,667 --> 02:45:27,875
Let stars gamble with the moon and sun

2283
02:45:27,875 --> 02:45:32,917
Who thinks of ancient sages now

2284
02:45:32,917 --> 02:45:39,667
- Yet great drinkers - we know every one.

2285
02:46:20,958 --> 02:46:25,958
With talent I have been endowed

2286
02:46:25,958 --> 02:46:31,167
I defy heaven and earth with my truth

2287
02:46:31,167 --> 02:46:36,083
Who thinks of ancient sages now

2288
02:46:36,083 --> 02:46:41,292
- Yet great drinkers - we know every one.

2289
02:46:41,292 --> 02:46:45,958
With talent I have been endowed

2290
02:46:45,958 --> 02:46:51,250
Let stars gamble with the moon and sun

2291
02:46:51,250 --> 02:46:56,167
Who thinks of ancient sages now

2292
02:46:56,167 --> 02:47:03,750
- Yet great drinkers - we know every one.

2293
02:47:03,750 --> 02:47:08,625
As the sun and I set down the mountain

2294
02:47:08,625 --> 02:47:13,292
Am I followed by the moon?

2295
02:47:13,292 --> 02:47:19,125
I search for the paths that led here

2296
02:47:19,125 --> 02:47:22,625
Again to green mountain forests

2297
02:47:22,625 --> 02:47:28,833
And blue mountain mists.
